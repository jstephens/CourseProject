## Progress Report

### Completed Tasks
I've started creating the pipeline for taking in books and analyzing the content. I'm also evaluating options for honing the dataset used and how to pick up missed English words that could uncover sentiment in original texts.


### Pending Tasks
Creating the front-end for the application.

### Challenges
I'm finding that a lot of words are viewed as neutral and as a result a lot of the texts I've inputted using the Hedonometer dataset have a sentiment reading of about 5 (neutral). I'm currently working with various methods to gain more meaning from the ratings I have for words, like creating a logarithmic scale or only including words with a very high or low sentiment rating.
