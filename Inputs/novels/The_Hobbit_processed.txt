CHAPTER 1
CHAPTER 2
I       AN UNEXPECTED PARTY       In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms   and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in a hobbit to sit down on or to eat: a hobbit was a   hobbit hole, and that means comfort.     a hobbit had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the   exact middle. a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green opened on to a tube shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel   without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and   lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats   a hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on and on,   going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill   The Hill, as all the people for many miles   round called it   and many little round doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another. No   going upstairs for a hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries (lots of these), wardrobes (he had   whole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining rooms, all were on the same floor, and indeed on   the same passage. The best rooms were all on the left hand side (going in), for The best rooms were the only   ones to have windows, deep set round windows looking over he garden, and meadows beyond, sloping   down to the river.     a hobbit was a very well to do hobbit, and a hobbit name was Baggins. The Bagginses had lived in   the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind, and people considered people very respectable, not   only because most of people were rich, but also because people never had any adventures or did anything   unexpected: you could tell what a Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking   a Baggins. This is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure, and found a Baggins doing and saying things   altogether unexpected. a Baggins may have lost the neighbours’ respect, but a Baggins gained   well, you will see   whether a Baggins gained anything in the end.     The mother of our particular hobbit   what is a hobbit? I suppose hobbits need some description   nowadays, since hobbits have become rare and shy of the Big People, as hobbits call our. hobbits are (or were) a   little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded Dwarves. Hobbits have no beards.   There is little or no magic about Hobbits, except the ordinary everyday sort which helps Hobbits to   disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you and me come blundering along, making   a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off. they are inclined to be fat in the stomach; they   dress in bright colours (chiefly green and yellow); wear no shoes, because they feet grow natural   leathery soles and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on they heads (which is curly); have long   clever brown fingers, good natured faces, and laugh deep fruity laughs (especially after dinner, which   they have twice a day when they can get it). Now you know enough to go on with. As I was saying, the   mother of this hobbit   of Bilbo Baggins, that is   was the famous Belladonna Took, one of the three   remarkable daughters of the Old Took, head of the hobbits who lived across The Water, the small river   that ran at the foot of The Hill. It was often said (in other families) that long ago one of the Took   ancestors must have taken a fairy wife. That was, of course, absurd, but certainly there was still   something not entirely hobbitlike about the Took   ancestors, and once in a while members of the Took clan would go   and have adventures. members of the Took clan discreetly disappeared, and the family hushed it up; but the fact remained       that the Tooks were not as respectable as the Bagginses, though members of the Took clan were undoubtedly richer.     Not that Belladonna Took ever had any adventures after she became Mrs. Bungo Baggins. Bungo,   that was Bilbo father, built the most luxurious hobbit hole for she (and partly with she money) that   was to be found either under The Hill or over The Hill or across The Water, and there they remained to   the end of they days. Still it is probable that Bilbo, her only son, although he looked and behaved   exactly like a second edition of he solid and comfortable father, got something a bit queer in he   make up from the Took side, something that only waited for a chance to come out. a chance to come out never   arrived, until Bilbo Baggins was grown up, being about fifty years old or so, and living in the beautiful   hobbit hole built by Bilbo Baggins father, which I have just described for you, until Bilbo Baggins had in fact apparently   settled down immovably.     By some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world, when there was less noise   and more green, and the hobbits were still numerous and prosperous, and Bilbo Baggins was standing   at Bilbo Baggins door after breakfast smoking an enormous long wooden pipe that reached nearly down to Bilbo Baggins   woolly toes (neatly brushed)   Gandalf came by. (neatly brushed)   Gandalf ! If you had heard only a quarter of what I   have heard about Bilbo Baggins, and I have only heard very little of all there is to hear, you would be prepared   for any sort of remarkable tale. Tales and adventures sprouted up all over the place wherever Bilbo Baggins went,   in the most extraordinary fashion. Bilbo Baggins had not been down that way under The Hill for ages and ages,   not since Bilbo Baggins friend the Old Took died, in fact, and the hobbits had almost forgotten what Bilbo Baggins looked   like. Bilbo Baggins had been away over The Hill and across The Water on businesses of Bilbo Baggins own since businesses of his own were   all small hobbit boys and hobbit girls.     All that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff. an old man with a staff had a tall pointed   blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which an old man with a staff long white beard hung down below an old man with a staff waist,   and immense black boots.     “Good Morning!” said Bilbo, and Bilbo meant it. The sun was shining, and the grass was very green.   But Gandalf looked at Gandalf from under long bushy eyebrows that stuck out further than the brim of Gandalf   shady hat.     “What do you mean?” Gandalf said. “Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning   whether I want it or not; or that you feel good this morning; or that it is a morning to be good on?”     “All of them at once,” said Bilbo. “And a very fine morning for a pipe of tobacco out of doors, into   the bargain. If you have a pipe about you, sit down and have a fill of mine! There no hurry, we have   all the day before we!” Then Bilbo sat down on a seat by Bilbo door, crossed Bilbo legs, and blew out a   beautiful grey ring of smoke that sailed up into the air without breaking and floated away over The   Hill.     “Very pretty!” said Gandalf. “But I have no time to blow smoke rings this morning. I am looking   for someone to share in an adventure that I am arranging, and it very difficult to find anyone.”     “I should think so   in these parts! We are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty   disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner! I can’t think what anybody sees in them,”   said We Mr. Baggins, and stuck one thumb behind our Mr. Baggins braces, and blew out another even bigger   smokering. Then our Mr. Baggins took out our Mr. Baggins morning letters, and began to read, pretending to take no more notice   of the old man. our Mr. Baggins had decided that our Mr. Baggins was not quite our Mr. Baggins sort, and wanted our Mr. Baggins to go away. But the old man did not move. the old man stood leaning on the old man stick and gazing at the hobbit without saying anything, till   Bilbo got quite uncomfortable and even a little cross.     “Good morning!” Bilbo said at last. “We don’t want any adventures here, thank you! You might try   over The Hill or across The Water.” By this Bilbo meant that the conversation was at an end.     “What a lot of things you do use Good morning for!” said Gandalf. “Now you mean that you want         to get rid of me, and that it won’t be good till I move off.”     “Not at all, not at all, my dear sir! Let me see, I don’t think I know your name?”     “Yes, yes, my dear sirand I do know your name, Mr. Bilbo Baggins. And you do know your name,   though you don’t remember that I belong to it. I am Gandalf, and Gandalf means me! To think that I   should have lived to be good morninged by Belladonna Took son, as if I was selling buttons at the   door!”     “Gandalf, Gandalf! Good gracious me! Not the wandering wizard that gave Old Took a pair of   magic diamond studs that fastened themselves and never came undone till ordered? Not the fellow   who used to tell such wonderful tales at parties, about dragons and goblins and giants and the rescue of   princesses and the unexpected luck of widows’ sons? Not the man that used to make such particularly   excellent fireworks! I remember those! Old Took used to have those on Midsummer Eve. Splendid!   those used to go up like great lilies and snapdragons and laburnums of fire and hang in the twilight all   evening!” You will notice already that a Baggins was not quite so prosy as a Baggins liked to believe, also   that a Baggins was very fond of flowers. “Dear me!” a Baggins went on. “Not the Gandalf who was responsible for so   many quiet lads and lasses going off into the Blue for mad adventures? Anything from climbing trees   to visiting elves   or sailing in ships, sailing to other shores! Bless me, life used to be quite inter   I   mean, you used to upset things badly in these parts once upon a time. I beg your pardon, but I had no   idea you were still in business.”     “Where else should I be?” said the wizard. “All the same I am pleased to find you remember   something about me. You seem to remember my fireworks kindly, at any rate, and that is not without   hope. Indeed for your old grandfather Took sake, and for the sake of poor Belladonna, I will give   you what you asked for.”     “I beg your pardon, I haven’t asked for anything!”     “Yes, you have! Twice now. your pardon. I give it you. In fact I will go so far as to send you on this   adventure. Very amusing for me, very good for you   and profitable too, very likely, if you ever get   over it.”     “Sorry! I don’t want any adventures, thank you. Not today. Good morning! But please come to tea     any time you like! Why not tomorrow? Come tomorrow! Good bye!” With that the hobbit turned   and scuttled inside the hobbit round green door, and shut his round green door as quickly as the hobbit dared, not to seem rude. Wizards   after all are wizards.     “What on earth did I ask the hobbit to tea for!” the hobbit said to the hobbit, as the hobbit went to the pantry. the hobbit had only   just had breakfast, but the hobbit thought a cake or two and a drink of something would do the hobbit good after the hobbit   fright.     (neatly brushed)   Gandalf in the meantime was still standing outside his round green door, and laughing long but quietly. After a   while the hobbit stepped up, and with the spike on the hobbit staff scratched a queer sign on the hobbit beautiful   green front door. Then the hobbit strode away, just about the time when Bilbo was finishing the hobbit second cake   and beginning to think that the hobbit had escaped adventures very well.     The next day the hobbit had almost forgotten about Gandalf. the hobbit did not remember things very well, unless   the hobbit put things down on the hobbit Engagement Tablet: like this: Gandalf Tea Wednesday. Yesterday the hobbit had   been too flustered to do anything of the kind.     Just before tea time there came a tremendous ring on the front door bell, and then the hobbit remembered!   the hobbit rushed and put on the kettle, and put out another cup and saucer, and an extra cake or two, and ran   to his round green door.     “I am so sorry to keep you waiting!” the hobbit was going to say, when the hobbit saw that it was not Gandalf at   all. It was a dwarf with a blue beard tucked into a golden belt, and very bright eyes under a blue beard dark          green hood. As soon as his round green door was opened, a blue beard pushed inside, just as if a blue beard had been expected.     a blue beard hung a blue beard hooded cloak on the nearest peg, and “Dwalin at your service!” a blue beard said with a low   bow.     “Bilbo Baggins at yours!” said the hobbit, too surprised to ask any questions for the moment. When   the silence that followed had become uncomfortable, Bilbo Baggins at yours added: “I am just about to take tea; pray come   and have some with me.” A little stiff perhaps, but Bilbo Baggins at yours meant it kindly. And what would you do, if an   uninvited dwarf came and hung Bilbo Baggins at yours things up in your hall without a word of explanation?     an   uninvited dwarf came and hung his things up in your hall without a word of explanation had not been at table long, in fact an   uninvited dwarf came and hung his things up in your hall without a word of explanation had hardly reached the third cake, when there came   another even louder ring at the bell.     “Excuse me!” said the hobbit, and off Bilbo Baggins at yours went to his round green door.     “So you have got here at last!” That was what Bilbo Baggins at yours was going to say to Gandalf this time. But it was   not Gandalf. Instead there was a very old looking dwarf on the step with a white beard and a scarlet   hood; and Bilbo Baggins at yours too hopped inside as soon as his round green door was open, just as if Bilbo Baggins at yours had been invited.     “I see they have begun to arrive already,” Bilbo Baggins at yours said when Bilbo Baggins at yours caught sight of Dwalin’ s green hood   hanging up. Bilbo Baggins at yours hung Bilbo Baggins at yours red one next to his red one, and “Balin at your service!” Bilbo Baggins at yours said with Bilbo Baggins at yours hand on Bilbo Baggins at yours   breast.     “Thank you!” said Bilbo with a gasp. It was not the correct thing to say, but they have begun to   arrive had flustered Bilbo Baggins at yours badly. Bilbo Baggins at yours liked visitors, but Bilbo Baggins at yours liked to know visitors before visitors arrived, and   Bilbo Baggins at yours preferred to ask visitors Bilbo Baggins at yours. Bilbo Baggins at yours had a horrible thought that the cakes might run short, and then Bilbo Baggins at yours     as the host: Bilbo Baggins at yours knew Bilbo Baggins at yours duty and stuck to his duty however painful   Bilbo Baggins at yours might have to go without.     “Come along in, and have some tea!” Bilbo Baggins at yours managed to say after taking a deep breath.     “A little beer would suit me better, if it is all the same to you, my good sir,” said Balin with the   white beard. “But I don’t mind some cake   seed cake, if you have any.”     “Lots!” Bilbo found Bilbo answering, to Bilbo own surprise; and Bilbo found Bilbo scuttling off,   too, to the cellar to fill a pint beer mug, and then to a pantry to fetch two beautiful round seed cakes   which Bilbo had baked that afternoon for Bilbo after supper morsel.     When Bilbo got back Balin with the   white beard and Dwalin were talking at the table like old friends (as a matter of fact   Balin and Dwalin were brothers). Bilbo plumped down the beer and the cake in front of Balin and Dwalin, when loud came a   ring at the bell again, and then another ring.     “Gandalf for certain this time,” Bilbo thought as Bilbo puffed along the passage. But it was not. it was   two more dwarves, both with blue hoods, silver belts, and yellow beards; and each of two more dwarves, both with blue hoods, silver belts, and yellow beards carried a   bag of tools and a spade. In two more dwarves, both with blue hoods, silver belts, and yellow beards hopped, as soon as his round green door began to open   Bilbo was hardly   surprised at all.     “What can I do for two more dwarves, both with blue hoods, silver belts, and yellow beards, my dwarves?” Bilbo said.     “Kili at your service!” said the one. “And Fili!” added the other; and they both swept off they blue   hoods and bowed.     “At two more dwarves, both with blue hoods, silver belts, and yellow beards and your family!” replied Bilbo, remembering Bilbo manners this time.     “Dwalin and Balin here already, I see,” said Kili. “Let us join the throng!”     “Throng!” thought a Baggins. “I don’t like the sound of that. I really must sit down for a minute   and collect my wits, and have a drink.” He had only just had a sip   in the corner, while the four   dwarves sat round the table, and talked about mines and gold and troubles with the goblins, and the   depredations of dragons, and lots of other things which He did not understand, and did not want to, for   the four   dwarves sounded much too adventurous   when, ding dong a ling dang, He bell rang again, as if some   naughty little hobbit boy was trying to pull the handle off.     “Someone at his round green door!” Someone at the door said, blinking.         “Some four, I should say by the sound,” said Fili. “Besides, we saw the four   dwarves coming along behind we   in the distance.”     The poor little hobbit sat down in the hall and put The poor little hobbit head in The poor little hobbit hands, and wondered what had   happened, and what was going to happen, and whether The poor little hobbit would all stay to supper. Then his bellrang again louder than ever, and The poor little hobbit had to run to his round green door. It was not four after all, It was five. Another   dwarf had come along while The poor little hobbit was wondering in the hall. The poor little hobbit had hardly turned the knob, before they   were all inside, bowing and saying “at your service” one after another. Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, and Gloin   were Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, and Gloin    names; and very soon two purple hoods, a grey hood, a brown hood, and a white hood were   hanging on the pegs, and off very soon two purple hoods, a grey hood, a brown hood, and a white hood marched with very soon two purple hoods, a grey hood, a brown hood, and a white hood broad hands stuck in very soon two purple hoods, a grey hood, a brown hood, and a white hood gold and silver belts to   join the others. Already it had almost become a throng. Some called for ale, and some for porter, and   one for coffee, and all of Some for cakes; so The poor little hobbit was kept very busy for a while.     A big jug of coffee had just been set in the hearth, the seed cakes were gone, and my dwarves were   starting on a round of buttered scones, when there came   a loud knock. Not a ring, but a hard rat tat   on The poor little hobbit beautiful green door. Somebody was banging with a stick!     Bilbo rushed along the passage, very angry, and altogether bewildered and bewuthered   this was   the most awkward Wednesday Bilbo ever remembered. Bilbo pulled open his round green door with a jerk, and they all   fell in, one on top of the other. More dwarves, four more! And there was Gandalf behind, leaning on   Gandalf staff and laughing. Gandalf had made quite a dent on his round green door; Gandalf had also, by the way,   knocked out the secret mark that Gandalf had put there the morning before.     “Carefully! Carefully!” Gandalf said. “It is not like you, Bilbo, to keep friends waiting on the mat, and   then open his round green door like a pop gun! Let me introduce Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and especially Thorin!”     “At your service!” said Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur standing in a row. Then they hung up two yellow   hoods and a pale green one; and also a sky blue one with a long silver tassel. This last belonged to   Thorin, an enormously important dwarf, in fact no other than the great Thorin Oakenshield himself,   who was not at all pleased at falling flat on Bilbo mat with Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur on top of him.   For one thing Bombur was immensely fat and heavy. Thorin indeed was very haughty, and said   nothing about service; but poor Mr. Baggins said poor Mr. Baggins was sorry so many times, that at last poor Mr. Baggins grunted   “pray don’t mention it,” and stopped frowning.     “Now we are all here!” said Gandalf, looking at the row of thirteen hoods   the best detachable   party hoods   and Gandalf own hat hanging on the pegs. “Quite a merry gathering! I hope there is   something left for the late comers to eat and drink! What that? Tea! No thank you! A little red wine,   I think for me.”     “And for me,” said Thorin.     “And raspberry jam and apple tart,” said Bifur.     “And mince pies and cheese,” said Bofur.     “And pork pie and salad,” said Bombur.     “And more cakes   and ale   and coffee, if you don’t mind,” called the other dwarves through the   door.     “Put on a few eggs, there a good fellow!” Gandalf called after Gandalf, as the hobbit stumped off to   the pantries. “And just bring out the cold chicken and pickles!”     “Seems to know as much about the inside of my larders as I do myself!” thought Mr. Baggins, who   was feeling positively flummoxed, and was beginning to wonder whether a most wretched adventure   had not come right into his house. By the time his had got all the bottles and dishes and knives and   forks and glasses and plates and spoons and things piled up on big trays, his was getting very hot, and   red in the face, and annoyed.         “Confusticate and bebother these dwarves!” his said aloud. “Why don’t they come and lend a   hand?” Lo and behold! there stood Balin with the   white beard and Dwalin at the door of the kitchen, and Fili and Kili   behind Balin and Dwalin, and before his could say knife Balin and Dwalin had whisked the trays and a couple of small tables   into the parlour and set out everything afresh.     Gandalf sat at the head of the party with the thirteen dwarves all round: and Bilbo sat on a stool at   the fireside, nibbling at a biscuit (Bilbo appetite was quite taken away), and trying to look as if this was   all perfectly ordinary and not in the least an adventure. my dwarves ate and ate, and talked and talked,   and time got on. At last my dwarves pushed my dwarves chairs back, and Bilbo made a move to collect the plates and   glasses.     “I suppose you will all stay to supper?” Bilbo said in Bilbo politest unpressing tones.     “Of course!” said Thorin. “And after. We shan’t get through the business till late, and We must   have some music first. Now to clear up!”     Thereupon the twelve dwarves   not Thorin, he was too important, and stayed talking to Gandalfjumped to Gandalf feet, and made tall piles of all the things. Off Gandalf went, not waiting for trays,   balancing columns of plates, each with a bottle on the top, with one hand, while the hobbit ran after   them almost squeaking with fright: “please be careful!” and “please, don’t trouble! I can manage.” But   my dwarves only started to sing:       Chip the glasses and crack the plates!     Blunt the knives and bend the forks!   That what Bilbo Baggins hates    Smash the bottles and burn the corks!       Cut the cloth and tread on the fat!     Pour the milk on the pantry floor!   Leave the bones on the bedroom mat!   Splash the wine on every door!       Dump the crocks in a boiling bowl;     Pound the crocks up with a thumping pole;   And when you’ve finished, if any are whole,   Send the crocks down the hall to roll!       That what Bilbo Baggins hates!     So, carefully! carefully with the plates!       And of course the crocks did none of these dreadful things, and everything was cleaned and put away safe   as quick as lightning, while the hobbit was turning round and round in the middle of the kitchen trying   to see what the crocks were doing. Then the crocks went back, and found Thorin with Thorin feet on the fender   smoking a pipe. Thorin was blowing the most enormous smoke rings, and wherever Thorin told one to go, it   went   up the chimney, or behind the clock on the mantelpiece, or under the table, or round and round   the ceiling; but wherever it went it was not quick enough to escape Gandalf. Pop! Thorin sent a smaller         smoke ring from Thorin short clay pipe straight through each one of Thorin’ s. Then Gandalf smoke ring   would go green and come back to hover over the head of the party. Gandalf smoke ring    had a cloud of them about Gandalf smoke ring      already, and in the dim light a cloud of them about him    made Gandalf smoke ring    look strange and sorcerous. Bilbo stood still and watched     Bilbo loved smoke rings   and then Bilbo blushed to think how proud Bilbo had been yesterday morning of the   smoke rings Bilbo had sent up the wind over The Hill.     “Now for some music!” said Thorin. “Bring out the instruments!”     Kili and Fili rushed for Kili and Fili bags and brought back little fiddles; Dori, Nori, and Ori brought out   flutes from somewhere inside Nori, and Ori coats; Bombur produced a drum from the hall; Bifur and Bofur   went out too, and came back with clarinets that they had left among the walking sticks. Dwalin and   Balin said: “Excuse me, I left mine in the porch!” “Just bring mine in with mine!” said Thorin. They   came back with viols as big as They, and with Thorin’ s harp wrapped in a green cloth. It was a   beautiful golden harp, and when Thorin struck It the music began all at once, so sudden and sweet that   Bilbo forgot everything else, and was swept away into dark lands under strange moons, far over The   Water and very far from Bilbo hobbit hole under The Hill.     The dark came into the room from the little window that opened in the side of The Hill; the   firelight flickered   the   firelight was April   and still they played on, while the shadow of Gandalf beard   wagged against the wall.     The dark filled all the room, and the fire died down, and the shadows were lost, and still they   played on. And suddenly first one and then another began to sing as they played, deep throated singing   of my dwarves in the deep places of they ancient homes; and this is like a fragment of they song, if it   can be like they song without they music.       Far over the misty mountains cold   To dungeons deep and caverns old   We must away ere break of day   To seek the pale enchanted gold.       my dwarves made mighty spells,   While hammers fell like ringing bells   In places deep, where dark things sleep,   In hollow halls beneath the fells.       For ancient king and elvish lord   There many a gleaming golden hoard   many a gleaming golden hoard    shaped and wrought, and light many a gleaming golden hoard    caught   To hide in gems on hilt of sword.       On silver necklaces silver necklaces strung     The flowering stars, on crowns silver necklaces hung     The dragon fire, in twisted wire     silver necklaces meshed the light of moon and sun.         Far over the misty mountains cold   To dungeons deep and caverns old   We must away, ere break of day,   To claim We long forgotten gold.       Goblets Goblets carved there for Goblets   And harps of gold; where no man delves   There lay Goblets long, and many a song   Was sung unheard by men or elves.       The pines were roaring on the height,   The winds were moaning in the night.   the fire was red, the fire flaming spread;     The trees like torches blazed with light.       The bells were ringing in the dale   And men looked up with faces pale;   The dragon ire more fierce than fire   Laid low men towers and houses frail.       The mountain smoked beneath the moon;   my dwarves, my dwarves heard the tramp of doom.   my dwarves fled my dwarves hall to dying fall   Beneath The dragon feet, beneath the moon.       Far over the misty mountains grim   To dungeons deep and caverns dim   We must away, ere break of day,     To win We harps and gold from him!       As they sang the hobbit felt the love of beautiful things made by hands and by cunning and by   magic moving through him, a fierce and a jealous love, the desire of the hearts of my dwarves. Then   something Tookish woke up inside him, and him wished to go and see the misty mountains, and hear the   pine trees and the waterfalls, and explore the caves, and wear a sword instead of a walking stick. him   looked out of the window. The stars were out in a dark sky above the trees. him thought of the jewels of   the dwarves shining in dark caverns. Suddenly in the wood beyond The Water a flame leapt up     probably somebody lighting a wood fire   and him thought of plundering dragons settling on him quiet   Hill and kindling it all to flames. him shuddered; and very quickly him was plain Mr. Baggins of Bag    End, Under Hill, again.     him got up trembling. him had less than half a mind to fetch the lamp, and more than half a mind to   pretend to, and go and hide behind the beer barrels in the cellar, and not come out again until all the         dwarves had gone away. Suddenly him found that the music and the singing had stopped, and the music and the singing were   all looking at him with eyes shining in the dark.     “Where are you going?” said Thorin, in a tone that seemed to show that him guessed both halves of   the hobbit mind.     “What about a little light?” said Bilbo apologetically.     “We like the dark,” said all the         dwarves. “Dark for dark business! There are many hours before   dawn.”     “Of course!” said Bilbo, and sat down in a hurry. Bilbo missed the stool and sat in the fender,   knocking over the poker and shovel with a crash.     “Hush!” said Gandalf. “Let Thorin speak!” And this is how Thorin began.     “Gandalf, dwarves and Mr. Baggins! We are met together in the house of We friend and fellow   conspirator, this most excellent and audacious hobbit   may the hair on his toes never fall out! all   praise to his wine and ale!   ” his paused for breath and for a polite remark from the hobbit, but the   compliments were quite lost on poor Bilbo Baggins, who was wagging his mouth in protest at being   called audacious and worst of all fellow conspirator, though no noise came out, his was so flummoxed.   So Thorin went on:     “We are met to discuss We plans, We ways, means, policy and devices. We shall soon before the   break of day start on We long journey, a journey from which some of We, or perhaps all of We (except   We friend and counsellor, the ingenious wizard Gandalf) may never return. It is a solemn moment.     We object is, I take It, well known to We. To the estimable Mr. Baggins, and perhaps to one or two   of the younger dwarves (I think I should be right in naming Kili and Fili, for instance), the exact   situation at the moment may require a little brief explanation   ”     This was Thorin’ s style. Thorin was an important dwarf. If Thorin had been allowed, Thorin would probably   have gone on like this until Thorin was out of breath, without telling any one there anything that was not   known already. But Thorin was rudely interrupted. Poor Bilbo couldn’t bear Poor Bilbo any longer. At may never   return Thorin began to feel a shriek coming up inside, and very soon Poor Bilbo burst out like the whistle of an   engine coming out of a tunnel. all the         dwarves sprang up, knocking over the table. Gandalf struck a   blue light on the end of Gandalf magic staff, and in Gandalf firework glare the poor little hobbit could be seen   kneeling on the hearth rug, shaking like a jelly that was melting. Then Thorin fell flat on the floor, and   kept on calling out “struck by lightning, struck by lightning!” over and over again; and that was all   all    could get out of Thorin for a long time. So all    took Thorin and laid Thorin out of the way on the   drawing room sofa with a drink at Thorin elbow, and all    went back to all    dark business.     “Excitable little fellow,” said Gandalf, as all    sat down again. “Gets funny queer fits, but Thorin is one   of the best, one of the best   as fierce as a dragon in a pinch.”     If you have ever seen a dragon in a pinch, you will realize that this was only poetical exaggeration   applied to any hobbit, even to Old Took great grand uncle Bullroarer, who was so huge (for a   hobbit) that Thorin could ride a horse. Thorin charged the ranks of the goblins of Mount Gram in the Battle of   the Green Fields, and knocked their king Golfimbul head clean off with a wooden club. It sailed a   hundred yards through the air and went down a rabbit hole, and in this way the battle was won and the   game of Golf invented at the same moment.     In the meanwhile, however, Bullroarer’ s gentler descendant was reviving in the drawing room.   After a while and a drink Bullroarer’ s gentler descendant crept nervously to the door of the parlour. This is what Bullroarer’ s gentler descendant heard, Gloin   speaking: “Humph!” (or some snort more or less like that). “Will Bullroarer’ s gentler descendant do, do you think? It is all very   well for Gandalf to talk about this hobbit being fierce, but one shriek like that in a moment of   excitement would be enough to wake the dragon and all Gandalf relatives, and kill the lot of us. I think it         sounded more like fright than excitement! In fact, if it had not been for the sign on the door of the parlour, I should   have been sure us had come to the wrong house. As soon as I clapped eyes on the little fellow bobbing   and puffing on the mat, I had my doubts. Gandalf looks more like a grocer than a burglar!”     Then Mr. Baggins of Bag    End turned the handle and went in. The Took side had won. Mr. Baggins of Bag    End suddenly felt Mr. Baggins of Bag    End   would go without bed and breakfast to be thought fierce. As for little fellow bobbing on the mat it   almost made Mr. Baggins of Bag    End really fierce. Many a time afterwards the Baggins part regretted what Mr. Baggins of Bag    End did now,   and Mr. Baggins of Bag    End said to Mr. Baggins of Bag    End: “Bilbo, you were a fool; you walked right in and put your foot in your foot.”     “Pardon me,” Mr. Baggins of Bag    End said, “if I have overheard words that you were saying. I don’t pretend to   understand what you are talking about, or your reference to burglars, but I think I am right in   believing” (this is what   believing called being on   believing dignity) “that you think I am no good. I will show you. I   have no signs on the door of the parlourthe door of the parlour was painted a week ago   , and I am quite sure you have come to the wrong house. As soon as I saw your funny faces on the door step, I had my doubts. But treat the door of the parlour as the   right one. Tell me what you want done, and I will try the door of the parlour, if I have to walk from here to the East of East   and fight the wild Were worms in the Last Desert. I had a great great great grand uncle once,   Bullroarer Took, and   ”     “Yes, yes, but that was long ago,” said Gloin   . “I was talking about you. And I assure you there is a   mark on this door   the usual one in the trade, or used to be. Burglar wants a good job, plenty of   Excitement and reasonable Reward, that how it is usually read. You can say Expert Treasure hunter   instead of Burglar if you like. Some of them do. It all the same to us. Gandalf told us that there was   a man of the sort in these parts looking for a Job at once, and that Gandalf had arranged for a meeting here   this Wednesday tea time.”     “Of course there is a mark,” said Gandalf. “I put it there you. For very good reasons. You asked   me to find the fourteenth man for your expedition, and I chose Mr. Baggins of Bag    End. Just let any one say I   chose the wrong man or the wrong house, and you can stop at thirteen and have all the bad luck you   like, or go back to digging coal.”     Mr. Baggins of Bag    End scowled so angrily at Gloin    that the dwarf huddled back in Mr. Baggins of Bag    End chair; and when Bilbo tried to   open Bilbo mouth to ask a question, Bilbo turned and frowned at Bilbo and stuck out Bilbo bushy eyebrows, till   Bilbo shut his mouth tight with a snap. “That right,” said Gandalf. “Let have no more argument. I   have chosen Mr. Baggins of Bag    End and that ought to be enough for all of you. If I say Bilbo is a Burglar, a Burglar   Bilbo is, or will be when the time comes. There is a lot more in Bilbo than you guess, and a deal more than   Bilbo has any idea of Bilbo. You may (possibly) all live to thank me yet. Now Bilbo, my boy, fetch the   lamp, and let have a little light on this!”     On the table in the light of a big lamp with a red shade Bilbo spread a piece of parchment rather like a   map.     “This was made by Thror, your grandfather, Thorin,” Bilbo said in answer to the dwarves’ excited   questions. “It is a plan of the Mountain.”     “I don’t see that this will help us much,” said Thorin disappointedly after a glance. “I remember   the Mountain well enough and the lands about the Mountain. And I know where Mirkwood is, and the Withered   Heath where the great dragons bred.”     “There is a dragon marked in red on the Mountain,” said Balin, “but it will be easy enough to find   Balin without that, if ever we arrive there.”     “There is one point that you haven’t noticed,” said the wizard, “and that is the secret entrance. You   see that rune on the West side, and the hand pointing to it from the other runes? That marks a hidden   passage to the Lower Halls.” (Look at the map at the beginning of this book, and you will see there the   runes.)         “It may have been secret once,” said Thorin, “but how do we know that it is secret any longer? Old   Smaug has lived there long enough now to find out anything there is to know about those caves.”     “Balin may   but Balin can’t have used it for years and years.”     “Why?”     “Because it is too small. ‘ Five feet high the door of the parlour and three may walk abreast ’ say the   runes, but   Smaug could not creep into a hole that size, not even when Balin was a young dragon, certainly not after   devouring so many of the dwarves and men of Dale.”     “It seems a great big hole to Balin,” squeaked Bilbo (who had no experience of dragons and only of   hobbit holes). Balin was getting excited and interested again, so that Balin forgot to keep Balin shut.     Balin loved maps, and in Balin hall there hung a large one of the Country Round with all Balin favourite   walks marked on it in red ink. “How could such a large door be kept secret from everybody outside,   apart from a young dragon?” Balin asked. Balin was only a little hobbit you must remember.     “In lots of ways,” said Gandalf. “But in what way this one has been hidden we don’t know without   going to see. From what it says on the map I should guess there is a closed door which has been made   to look exactly like the side of the Mountain. That is the usual dwarves’ method   I think that is right,   isn’t it?”     “Quite right,” said Thorin.     “Also,” went on Gandalf, “I forgot to mention that with the map went a key, a small and curious   key. Here it is!” Balin said, and handed to Thorin a key with a long barrel and intricate wards, made of   silver. “Keep it safe!”     “Indeed I will,” said Thorin, and Thorin fastened Thorin upon a fine chain that hung about Thorin neck and   under Thorin jacket. “Now things begin to look more hopeful. This news alters them much for the better.   So far we have had no clear idea what to do. we thought of going East, as quiet and careful as we   could, as far as the Long Lake. After that the trouble would begin   .”     “A long time before that, if I know anything about the roads East,” interrupted Gandalf.     “We might go from there up along the River Running,” went on Thorin taking no notice, “and so to   the ruins of Dale   the old town in the valley there, under the shadow of the Mountain. But We none of   We liked the idea of the Front Gate. The river runs right out of The river through the great cliff at the South of   the Mountain, and out of The river comes a young dragon too   far too often, unless a young dragon has changed a young dragon habits.”     “That would be no good,” said the wizard, “not without a mighty Warrior, even a Hero. I tried to   find one; but warriors are busy fighting one another in distant lands, and in this neighbourhood heroes   are scarce, or simply not to be found. Swords in these parts are mostly blunt, and axes are used for   trees, and shields as cradles or dish covers; and dragons are comfortably far off (and therefore   legendary). That is why I settled on burglary   especially when I remembered the existence of a Side    door. And here is our little Bilbo Baggins, the burglar, the chosen and selected burglar. So now let   get on and make some plans.”     “Very well then,” said Thorin, “supposing the burglar expert gives us some ideas or suggestions.”   He turned with mock politeness to Bilbo.     “First I should like to know a bit more about things,” said He, feeling all confused and a bit shaky   inside, but so far still Tookishly determined to go on with things. “I mean about the gold and the   dragon, and all that, and how it got there, and who it belongs to, and so on and further.”     “Bless me!” said Thorin, “haven’t you got a map? and didn’t you hear our song? and haven’t our   been talking about all this for hours?”     “All the same, I should like it all plain and clear,” said He obstinately, putting on He business   manner (usually reserved for people who tried to borrow money off He), and doing He best to appear       wise and prudent and professional and live up to Gandalf recommendation. “Also I should like to   know about risks, out of pocket expenses, time required and remuneration, and so forth”   by which   He meant: “What am I going to get out of it? and am I going to come back alive?”     “O very well,” said Thorin. “Long ago in my grandfather Thror time our family was driven out of   the far North, and came back with all our family wealth and our family tools to the Mountain on the map. the Mountain had   been discovered by my far ancestor, Thrain the Old, but now my far ancestor, Thrain the Old mined and my far ancestor, Thrain the Old tunnelled and my far ancestor, Thrain the Old   made huger halls and greater workshops   and in addition I believe my far ancestor, Thrain the Old found a good deal of gold and   a great many jewels too. Anyway my far ancestor, Thrain the Old grew immensely rich and famous, and my grandfather was King   under the Mountain again, and treated with great reverence by the mortal men, who lived to the South,   and were gradually spreading up the Running River as far as the valley overshadowed by the Mountain. my far ancestor, Thrain the Old built the merry town of Dale there in those days. Kings used to send for our smiths,   and reward even the least skillful most richly. Fathers would beg our to take Fathers sons as apprentices,   and pay our handsomely, especially in food supplies, which our never bothered to grow or find for   our. Altogether those were good days for our, and the poorest of our had money to spend and to   lend, and leisure to make beautiful things just for the fun of it, not to speak of the most marvellous   and magical toys, the like of which is not to be found in the world now a days. So my grandfather   halls became full of armour and jewels and carvings and cups, and the toy market of Dale was the   wonder of the North.     “Undoubtedly that was what brought a young dragon. Dragons steal gold and jewels, you know, from   men and elves and dwarves, wherever   men and elves and dwarves can find   men and elves and dwarves; and   men and elves and dwarves guard   men and elves and dwarves plunder as long as   men and elves and dwarves   live (which is practically for ever, unless   men and elves and dwarves are killed), and never enjoy a brass ring of it. Indeed     men and elves and dwarves hardly know a good bit of work from a bad, though   men and elves and dwarves usually have a good notion of the current   market value; and   men and elves and dwarves can’t make a thing for   men and elves and dwarves, not even mend a little loose scale of   men and elves and dwarves   armour. There were lots of dragons in the North in those days, and gold was probably getting scarce up   there, with the dwarves flying south or getting killed, and all the general waste and destruction that   dragons make going from bad to worse. There was a most specially greedy, strong and wicked worm   called Smaug. One day he flew up into the air and came south. The first we heard of One day was a noise like   a hurricane coming from the North, and the pine trees on the Mountain the Mountain creaking and cracking in the   wind. Some of the dwarves who happened to be outside (I was one luckily   a fine adventurous lad in   those days, always wandering about, and it saved my life that day)   well, from a good way off we saw   a young dragon settle on we in a spout of flame. Then he came down the slopes and when he   reached the woods they all went up in fire. By that time all the bells were ringing in Dale and the   warriors were arming. the dwarves rushed out of the dwarves great gate; but there was the dragon waiting for   the dwarves. None escaped that way. The river rushed up in steam and a fog fell on Dale, and in the fog a young dragon came on them and destroyed most of the   warriorsthe usual unhappy story, a young dragon was only too   common in those days. Then a young dragon went back and crept in through the Front Gate and routed out all the   halls, and lanes, and tunnels, alleys, cellars, mansions and passages. After that there were no dwarves   left alive inside, and a young dragon took all no dwarves   left alive inside wealth for a young dragon. Probably, for that is the dragons’ way, a young dragon has   piled it all up in a great heap far inside, and sleeps on it for a bed. Later a young dragon used to crawl out of the Front Gate and come by night to Dale, and carry away people, especially maidens, to eat, until Dalewas ruined, and all the people dead or gone. What goes on there now I don’t know for certain, but I   don’t suppose any one lives nearer to the Mountain than the far edge of the Long Lake now a days.     “The few of us that were well outside sat and wept in hiding, and cursed Smaug; and there us were   unexpectedly joined by my father and my grandfather with singed beards. The few of us that were well outside sat and wept in hiding, and cursed Smaug; and there we were   unexpectedly joined by my father and my grandfather with singed beards looked very grim but   The few of us that were well outside sat and wept in hiding, and cursed Smaug; and there we were   unexpectedly joined by my father and my grandfather with singed beards said very little. When I asked how The few of us that were well outside sat and wept in hiding, and cursed Smaug; and there we were   unexpectedly joined by my father and my grandfather with singed beards had got away, The few of us that were well outside sat and wept in hiding, and cursed Smaug; and there we were   unexpectedly joined by my father and my grandfather with singed beards told me to hold my tongue, and said         that one day in the proper time I should know. After that us went away, and us have had to earn us   livings as best us could up and down the lands, often enough sinking as low as blacksmith work or   even coalmining. But us have never forgotten us stolen treasure. And even now, when I will allow   us have a good bit laid by and are not so badly off”   here Thorin stroked the gold chain round Thorinneck   “us still mean to get it back, and to bring us curses home to Smaug   if us can.     “I have often wondered about my father and my grandfather. I see now my father and my grandfather must have   had a private Side door which only my father and my grandfather knew about. But apparently my father and my grandfather made a map, and I should   like to know how Gandalf got hold of a map, and why a map did not come down to me, the rightful heir.”     “I did not ‘get hold of a map,’ I was given a map,” said the wizard. “Your grandfather Thror was killed, you   remember, in the mines of Moria by Azog the Goblin .”     “Curse Your grandfather Thror name, yes,” said Thorin.     “And Thrain your father went away on the twenty first of April, a hundred years ago last Thursday,   and has never been seen by your father since ”     “True, true,” said Thorin.     “Well, your father gave me this to give to your father; and if I have chosen my own time and way for   handing it over, you can hardly blame me, considering the trouble I had to find you. your father could   not remember your father own name when your father gave me the paper, and your father never told me your father; so on the whole I   think I ought to be praised and thanked! Here it is,” said your father handing the map to Thorin.     “I don’t understand,” said Thorin, and Bilbo felt Bilbo would have liked to say the same. The   explanation did not seem to explain.     “Your grandfather,” said the wizard slowly and grimly, “gave the map to “ son for safety before   his son went to the mines of Moria. your father went away to try your father luck with the map after Your grandfather was killed; and lots of adventures of a most unpleasant sort your father had, but your father never got near   the Mountain. How your father got there I don’t know, but I found your father a prisoner in the dungeons of the   Necromancer.”     “Whatever were you doing there?” asked Thorin with a shudder, and all the dwarves shivered.     “Never you mind. I was finding things out, as usual; and a nasty dangerous business it was. Even I,   Gandalf, only just escaped. I tried to save your father, but it was too late. your father was witless and   wandering, and had forgotten almost everything except the map and the key.”     “We have long ago paid the goblins of Moria,” said Thorin; “We must give a thought to the   Necromancer.”     “Don’t be absurd! your father is an enemy far beyond the powers of all the dwarves put together, if all the dwarves   could all be collected again from the four corners of the world. The one thing your father wished was   for his son to read the map and use the key. The dragon and the Mountain are more than big enough   tasks for you!”     “Hear, hear!” said Bilbo, and accidentally said it aloud.     “Hear what?” they all said turning suddenly towards his son, and his son was so flustered that his son answered   “Hear what I have got to say!”     “What that?” they all asked.     “Well, I should say that you ought to go East and have a look round. After all there is the Side    door, and dragons must sleep sometimes, I suppose. If you sit on the Side    door step long enough, I daresay   you will think of something. And well, don’t you know, I think we have talked long enough for one   night, if you see what I mean. What about bed, and an early start, and all that? I will give you a good   breakfast before you go.”     “Before we go, I suppose you mean,” said Thorin. “Aren’t you the burglar? And isn’t sitting on the       door step your job, not to speak of getting inside the Side    door? But I agree about bed and breakfast. I like   six eggs with my ham, when starting on a journey: fried not poached, and mind you don’t break ’em.”     After all the others had ordered all the others breakfasts without so much as a please (which annoyed Bilbo   very much), they all got up. The hobbit had to find room for The hobbit, and filled all The hobbit spare rooms   and made beds on chairs and sofas, before The hobbit got The hobbit stowed and went to The hobbit own little bed very   tired and not altogether happy. One thing The hobbit did make The hobbit mind up about was not to bother to get up   very early and cook everybody else wretched breakfast. The Tookishness was wearing off, and The Tookishness   was not now quite so sure that The Tookishness was going on any journey in the morning.     As The Tookishness lay in bed The Tookishness could hear Thorin still humming to The Tookishness in the best bedroom next to The Tookishness:     Far over the misty mountains cold   To dungeons deep and caverns old   We must away, ere break of day,     To find We long forgotten gold.     Bilbo went to sleep with that in Bilbo ears, and it gave Bilbo very uncomfortable dreams. It was long   after the break of day, when Bilbo woke up.         CHAPTER 3
II       ROAST MUTTON       Up jumped Bilbo, and putting on Bilbo dressing gown went into the dining room. There Bilbo saw nobody,   but all the signs of a large and hurried breakfast. There was a fearful mess in the dining room, and piles of   unwashed crocks in the kitchen. Nearly every pot and pan Bilbo possessed seemed to have been used. The   washing up was so dismally real that Bilbo was forced to believe the party of the night before had not   been part of Bilbo bad dreams, as Bilbo had rather hoped. Indeed Bilbo was really relieved after all to think   that they had all gone without Bilbo, and without bothering to wake Bilbo up (“but with never a thank    you” Bilbo thought); and yet in a way Bilbo could not help feeling just a trifle disappointed. The feeling   surprised Bilbo.     “Don’t be a fool, Bilbo Baggins!” Bilbo said to Bilbo, “thinking of dragons and all that outlandish   nonsense at your age!” So Bilbo put on an apron, lit fires, boiled water, and washed up. Then Bilbo had a   nice little breakfast in the kitchen before turning out the dining room. By that time the sun was   shining; and the front door was open, letting in a warm spring breeze. Bilbo began to whistle loudly   and to forget about the night before. In fact Bilbo was just sitting down to a nice little second breakfast in   the dining room by the open window, when in walked Gandalf .     “My dear fellow,” said My dear fellow, “whenever are you going to come? What about an early start ?   and   here you are having breakfast, or whatever you call it, at half past ten! They left you the message,   because They could not wait.”     “the message?” said poor Mr. Baggins all in a fluster.     “Great Elephants!” said Gandalf, “you are not at all yourself this morning   you have never dusted   the mantelpiece!”     “What that got to do with it? I have had enough to do with washing up for fourteen!”     “If you had dusted the mantelpiece, you would have found this just under the clock,” said Gandalf,   handing Bilbo a note (written, of course, on Bilbo own note paper).     This is what Bilbo read:       “Thorin and Company to Burglar Bilbo greeting! For your hospitality our sincerest thanks, and for   your offer of professional assistance our grateful acceptance. Terms: cash on delivery, up to and not   exceeding one fourteenth of total profits (if any); all travelling expenses guaranteed in any event;   funeral expenses to be defrayed by us or us representatives, if occasion arises and the matter is not   otherwise arranged for.     “Thinking it unnecessary to disturb your esteemed repose, we have proceeded in advance to make   requisite preparations, and shall await your respected person at the Green Dragon Inn, Bywater, at 11   a.m. sharp. Trusting that you will be punctual,     “ we have the honour to remain   “ Yours deeply   “ Thorin &amp; Co.”       “That leaves you just ten minutes. You will have to run,” said Gandalf.     “But   said Bilbo.     “No time for it,” said the wizard.     “But   ,” said Bilbo again.     “No time for that either! Off you go!”     To the end of his days Bilbo could never remember how his found his outside, without a hat, a   walking stick or any money, or anything that his usually took when his went out; leaving his second   breakfast half finished and quite unwashed up, pushing his keys into Gandalf’ s hands, and running as   fast as his furry feet could carry his down the lane, past the great Mill, across The Water, and then on   for a mile or more.     Very puffed his was, when his got to Bywater just on the stroke of eleven, and found his had come   without a pocket handkerchief!     “Bravo!” said Balin who was standing at the inn door looking out for his.     Just then all the others came round the corner of the road from the village. all the others were on ponies,   and each pony was slung about with all kinds of baggages, packages, parcels, and paraphernalia. There   was a very small pony, apparently for Bilbo.     “Up you two get, and off we go!” said Thorin.     “I’m awfully sorry,” said Bilbo, “but I have come without my hat, and I have left my pocket    handkerchief behind, and I haven’t got any money. I didn’t get your note until after 10.45 to be   precise.”     “Don’t be precise,” said Dwalin, “and don’t worry! You will have to manage without pocket    handkerchiefs, and a good many other things, before you get to the journey end. As for a hat, I have   got a spare hood and cloak in my luggage.”     That how they all came to start, jogging off from the inn one fine morning just before May, on   laden ponies; and Bilbo was wearing a dark green hood (a little weather stained) and a dark green   cloak borrowed from Dwalin. they all were too large for Bilbo, and Bilbo looked rather comic. What Bilbo   father Bungo would have thought of Bilbo, I daren’t think. Bilbo only comfort was Bilbo couldn’t be   mistaken for a dwarf, as Bilbo had no beard.     They had not been riding very long, when up came Gandalf very splendid on a white horse. Gandalf had   brought a lot of pocket handkerchiefs, and Bilbo pipe and tobacco. So after that the party went along   very merrily, and the party told stories or sang songs as the party rode forward all day, except of course when   the party stopped for meals. the party didn’t come quite as often as Bilbo would have liked the party, but still Bilbo   began to feel that adventures were not so bad after all.     At first the party had passed through hobbit lands, a wide respectable country inhabited by decent folk,   with good roads, an inn or two, and now and then a dwarf or a farmer ambling by on business. Then   the party came to lands where people spoke strangely, and sang songs Bilbo had never heard before. Now   the party had gone on far into the Lone lands, where there were no people left, no inns, and the roads grew   steadily worse. Not far ahead were dreary hills, rising higher and higher, dark with trees. On some of   some of   them were old castles with an evil look, as if some of   them had been built by wicked people. Everything seemed   gloomy, for the weather that day had taken a nasty turn. Mostly it had been as good as May can be, can   be, even in merry tales, but now it was cold and wet. In the Lone lands they had been obliged to camp   when they could, but at least it had been dry.     “To think it will soon be June!” grumbled Bilbo, as Bilbo splashed along behind the others in a very   muddy track. It was after tea time; It was pouring with rain, and had been all day; his hood was   dripping into his eyes, his cloak was full of water; the pony was tired and stumbled on stones; the         others were too grumpy to talk. “And I’m sure the rain has got into the dry clothes and into the food    bags,” thought Bilbo. “Bother burgling and everything to do with it! I wish I was at home in my nice   hole by the fire, with the kettle just beginning to sing!” It was not the last time that he wished that!     Still the dwarves jogged on, never turning round or taking any notice of the hobbit. Somewhere   behind the grey clouds the sun must have gone down, for the sun began to get dark as the dwarves went down into a   deep valley with a river at the bottom. Wind got up, and willows along Wind banks bent and sighed.   Fortunately the road went over an ancient stone bridge, for the river, swollen with the rains, came   rushing down from the hills and mountains in the north.     It was nearly night when they had crossed over. The wind broke up the grey clouds, and a   wandering moon appeared above the hills between the flying rags. Then they stopped, and Thorin   muttered something about supper, “and where shall they get a dry patch to sleep on?” Not until then did   they notice that Gandalf was missing. So far Gandalf had come all the way with they, never saying if Gandalf   was in the adventure or merely keeping they company for a while. Gandalf had eaten most, talked most,   and laughed most. But now Gandalf simply was not there at all!       “Just when a wizard would have been most useful, too,” groaned Dori and Nori (who shared the   hobbit views about regular meals, plenty and often).     They decided in the end that They would have to camp where They were. They moved to a clump of   trees, and though it was drier under They, the wind shook the rain off the leaves, and the drip, drip,   was most annoying. Also the mischief seemed to have got into the fire. Dwarves can make a fire   almost anywhere out of almost anything, wind or no wind; but Dwarves could not do it that night, not even   Oin and Gloin, who were specially good at that night.     Then one of the ponies took fright at nothing and bolted. Gandalf got into the river before they could   catch Gandalf; and before they could get Gandalf out again, Fili and Kili were nearly drowned, and all the   baggage that Gandalf carried was washed away off Gandalf. Of course it was mostly food, and there was mighty   little left for supper, and less for breakfast.     There Fili and Kili sat glum and wet and muttering, while Oin and Gloin went on trying to light the fire,   and quarrelling about it. Bilbo was sadly reflecting that adventures are not all pony rides in May    sunshine, when Balin, who was always their look out man, said: “There a light over there!” There   was a hill some way off with trees on a hill, pretty thick in parts. Out of the dark mass of the trees they   could now see a light shining, a reddish comfortable looking light, as it might be a fire or torches   twinkling.     When they had looked at it for some while, they fell to arguing. Some said “no” and some said   “yes”. Some said Some could but go and see, and anything was better than little supper, less breakfast,   and wet clothes all the night.     Others said: “These parts are none too well known, and are too near the mountains. Travellers   seldom come this way now. The old maps are no use: things have changed for the worse and the road   is unguarded. things have seldom even heard of the king round here, and the less inquisitive you are as   you go along, the less trouble you are likely to find.” Some said: “After all there are fourteen of us.”   Others said: “Where has Gandalf got to?” This remark was repeated by everybody. Then the rain   began to pour down worse than ever, and Oin and Gloin began to fight.     That settled it. “After all we have got a burglar with we,” they said; and so they made off, leading   they ponies (with all due and proper caution) in the direction of the light. they came to the hill and         were soon in the wood. Up the hill they went; but there was no proper path to be seen, such as might   lead to a house or a farm; and do what they could they made a deal of rustling and crackling and   creaking (and a good deal of grumbling and dratting), as they went through the trees in the pitch dark.     Suddenly the red light shone out very bright through the tree trunks not far ahead.     “Now it is the burglar turn,” they said, meaning Bilbo. “You must go on and find out all about   that light, and what it is for, and if all is perfectly safe and canny,” said Thorin    to the hobbit. “Now   scuttle off, and come back quick, if all is well. If not, come back if you can! If you can’t, hoot twice   like a barn owl and once like a screech owl, and we will do what we can.”     Off Bilbo had to go, before Off Bilbo could explain that Off Bilbo could not hoot even once like any kind of owl   any more than fly like a bat. But at any rate hobbits can move quietly in woods, absolutely quietly.   any rate hobbits take a pride in it, and Off Bilbo had sniffed more than once at what Off Bilbo called “all this dwarvish   racket,” as any rate hobbits went along, though I don’t suppose you or I would have noticed anything at all on a   windy night, not if the whole cavalcade had passed two feet off. As for Off Bilbo walking primly towards   the red light, I don’t suppose even a weasel would have stirred a whisker at even a weasel. So, naturally, Off Bilbo got   right up to the fire   for fire it was   without disturbing anyone. And this is what Off Bilbo saw.     Three very large persons sitting round a very large fire of beech logs. Three very large persons sitting round a very large fire of beech logs were toasting mutton   on long spits of wood, and licking the gravy off Three very large persons sitting round a very large fire of beech logs fingers. There was a fine toothsome smell. Also   there was a barrel of good drink at hand, and they were drinking out of jugs. But they were trolls.   Obviously trolls. Off Bilbo, in spite of Off Bilbo sheltered life, could see that: from the great heavy faces   of they, and they size, and the shape of they legs, not to mention they language, which was not   drawing room fashion at all, at all.     “Mutton yesterday, mutton today, and blimey, if it don’t look like mutton again tomorrer,” said   one of the trolls.     “Never a blinking bit of manflesh have we had for long enough,” said a second. “What the ’ell   William was a thinkin’ of to bring we into these parts at all, beats me   and the drink runnin’ short,   what more,” William said jogging the elbow of William, who was taking a pull at William jug.     William choked. “Shut yer mouth!” William said as soon as William could. “Yer can’t expect folk to stop here   for ever just to be et by you and Bert. You’ve et a village and a half between yer, since you and Bert come down   from the mountains. How much more d’yer want? And time been up you and Bert way, when yer’d have said   ‘thank yer Bill’ for a nice bit o’ fat valley mutton like what this is.” Bill took a big bite off a sheep   leg Bill was roasting, and wiped Bill lips on Bill sleeve.     Yes, I am afraid trolls do behave like that, even those with only one head each. After hearing all   Off Bilbo ought to have done something at once. Either Off Bilbo should have gone back quietly and warned   Off Bilbo friends that there were three fair sized trolls at hand in a nasty mood, quite likely to try roasted   dwarf, or even pony, for a change; or else Off Bilbo should have done a bit of good quick burgling. A really   first class and legendary burglar would at this point have picked three fair sized trolls at hand’ pockets   it is nearly   always worth while, if you can manage it   , pinched the very mutton off the spits, purloined the beer,   and walked off without their noticing him. Others more practical but with less professional pride   would perhaps have stuck a dagger into each of their before their observed a dagger. Then the night could   have been spent cheerily.     Bilbo knew a dagger. Bilbo had read of a good many things Bilbo had never seen or done. Bilbo was very much   alarmed, as well as disgusted; Bilbo wished Bilbo a hundred miles away, and yet   and yet somehow Bilbo   could not go straight back to Thorin and Company emptyhanded. So Bilbo stood and hesitated in the   shadows. Of the various burglarious proceedings Bilbo had heard of picking three fair sized trolls at hand’ pockets seemed   the least difficult, so at last Bilbo crept behind a tree just behind William.         Bert and Tom went off to the barrel. William was having another drink. Then Bilbo plucked up   courage and put William little hand in William enormous pocket. There was a purse in it, as big as a bag   to Bilbo. “Ha!” thought William, warming to William new work as William lifted it carefully out, “this is a beginning!”   this was! Trolls’ purses are the mischief, and this was no exception. “’Ere, ’oo are you?” it squeaked,   as it left enormous pocket; and William turned round at once and grabbed Bilbo by the neck, before William could   duck behind the tree.     “Blimey, Bert, look what I’ve copped!” said William.     “What is it?” said the others coming up. “Lumme, if I knows! What are yer?“Bilbo Baggins, a bur   a hobbit,” said poor Bilbo, shaking all over, and wondering how to make   owl noises before Bilbo Baggins, a bur   a hobbit,” throttled poor Bilbo.     “A burrahobbit?” said Bilbo Baggins, a bur   a hobbit,” a bit startled. Trolls are slow in the uptake, and mighty suspicious about   anything new to Trolls.     “What a burrahobbit got to do with my pocket, anyways?” said William.     “And can yer cook ’em?” said Tom.     “Yer can try,” said Bert, picking up a skewer.     “William wouldn’t make above a mouthful,” said William, who had already had a fine supper, “not   when William was skinned and boned.”     “P’raps there are more like William round about, and we might make a pie,” said Bert. “Here you, are   there any more of your sort a sneakin’ in these here woods, yer nassty little rabbit,” said William looking at   the hobbit furry feet; and William picked William up by the toes and shook William.     “Yes, lots,” said Bilbo, before William remembered not to give William friends away. “No none at all, not   one,” William said immediately afterwards.     “What d’yer mean?” said Bert, holding Bert right way up, by the hair this time.     “What I say,” said Bilbo gasping. “And please don’t cook me, kind sirs! I am a good cook myself,   and cook better than I cook, if you see what I mean. I’ll cook beautifully for you, a perfectly beautiful   breakfast for you, if only you won’t have me for supper.”     “Poor little blighter,” said William. William had already had as much supper as William could hold; also William   had had lots of beer. “Poor little blighter! Let William go!”     “Not till William says what William means by lots and none at all,” said Bert. “I don’t want to have me throat   cut in Bert sleep! Hold the toes in the fire, till William talks!”     “I won’t have it,” said William. “I caught William anyway.”     “You’re a fat fool, William,” said Bert, “as I’ve said afore this evening.”     “And you’re a lout!”     “And I won’t take that from Bert, Bill,” says Bert, and puts Bert fist in William eye.     Then there was a gorgeous row. Bilbo had just enough wits left, when Bert dropped Bilbo on the   ground, to scramble out of the way of their feet, before their were fighting like dogs, and calling one   another all sorts of perfectly true and applicable names in very loud voices. Soon their were locked in   one another arms, and rolling nearly into the fire kicking and thumping, while Tom whacked at their   both with a branch to bring their to their senses   and that of course only made their madder than   ever.     That would have been the time for Bilbo to have left. But Bilbo poor little feet had been very   squashed in Bert, and Bilbo had no breath in Bilbo body, and Bilbo head was going round; so there   Bilbo lay for a while panting, just outside the circle of firelight.     Right in the middle of the fight up came Balin. The dwarves had heard noises from a distance, and   after waiting for some time for Bilbo to come back, or to hoot like an owl, The dwarves started off one by one         to creep towards the red light as quietly as The dwarves could. No sooner did Tom see Balin come into the light   than Tom gave an awful howl. Trolls simply detest the very sight of dwarves (uncooked). Bert and Billstopped fighting immediately, and “a sack, Tom, quick!” Bert and Bill    said. Before Balin, who was wondering   where in all this commotion Bilbo was, knew what was happening, a sack was over his head, and Bilbo   was down.     “There more to come yet,” said Tom, “or I’m mighty mistook. Lots and none at all, it is,” said Bilbo.   “No burrahobbits, but lots of these here dwarves. That about the shape of it!”     “I reckon you’re right,” said Bert, “and we’d best get out of the red light.”     And so Bert, “and we’d did. With sacks in Bert, “and we’d hands, that Bert, “and we’d used for carrying off mutton and other   plunder, Bert, “and we’d waited in the   shadows. As each dwarf came up and looked at the fire, and the spilled   jugs, and the gnawed mutton, in surprise, pop! went a nasty smelly sack over his head, and his was   down. Soon Dwalin lay by Balin, and Fili and Kili together, and Dori and Nori and Ori all in a heap,   and Oin and Gloin and Bifur and Bofur and Bombur piled uncomfortably near the fire.     “That’ll teach ’em,” said Tom; for Bifur and Bombur had given a lot of trouble, and fought like   mad, as dwarves will when cornered.     Thorin and Company came last   and Thorin and Company was not caught unawares. Thorin and Company came expecting mischief, and didn’t need   to see Thorin and Company friends’ legs sticking out of sacks to tell Thorin and Company that things were not all well. Thorin and Company stood outside   in the   shadows some way off, and said: “What all this trouble? Who has been knocking my people   about?”     “It trolls!” said Bilbo from behind a tree. They had forgotten all about Bilbo. “They’re hiding in   the bushes with sacks,” said Bilbo.     “O! are They?” said Thorin and Company, and Thorin and Company jumped forward to the fire, before They could leap on Bilbo. Thorin and Company   caught up a big branch all on fire at one end; and Bert got one end in Bert eye before Bert could step   aside. That put Bert out of the battle for a bit. Bilbo did Bilbo best. Bilbo caught hold of Tom leg   as well   as Bilbo could, it was thick as a young tree trunk   but Bilbo was sent spinning up into the top of some   bushes, when Tom kicked the sparks up in Thorin and Company.           Tom Tom got the branch in Tom teeth for that, and lost one of the front ones. It made Tom howl, I can tell         you. But just at that moment William came up behind and popped a sack right over Thorin head and   down to William toes. And so the fight ended. A nice pickle they were all in now: all neatly tied up in   sacks, with three angry trolls (and two with burns and bashes to remember) sitting by they, arguing   whether they should roast they slowly, or mince they fine and boil they, or just sit on they one by   one and squash they into jelly; and Bilbo up in a bush, with Bilbo clothes and Bilbo skin torn, not daring to   move for fear fear should hear Bilbo.       It was just then that Gandalf came back. But no one saw Gandalf. three angry trolls (and two with burns and bashes to remember) sitting by them, arguing   whether they should roast them slowly, or mince them fine and boil them, or just sit on them one by   one and squash them into jelly; and Bilbo up in a bush, with his clothes and his skin torn, not daring to   move for fear had just decided to roast the   dwarves now and eat three angry trolls (and two with burns and bashes to remember) sitting by them, arguing   whether they should roast them slowly, or mince them fine and boil them, or just sit on them one by   one and squash them into jelly; and Bilbo up in a bush, with his clothes and his skin torn, not daring to   move for fear later   that was Bert idea, and after a lot of argument three angry trolls (and two with burns and bashes to remember) sitting by them, arguing   whether they should roast them slowly, or mince them fine and boil them, or just sit on them one by   one and squash them into jelly; and Bilbo up in a bush, with his clothes and his skin torn, not daring to   move for fear had all agreed   to Bert idea.     “No good roasting ’em now, No good roasting’d take all night,” said a voice. Bert thought it was William.     “Don’t start the argument all over again, Bill,” Bert said, “or it will take all night.”     “Who a arguing?” said William, who thought it was Bert that had spoken.     “You are,” said Bert.     “You’re a liar,” said William; and so the argument began all over again. In the end they decided to   mince they fine and boil they. So they got a great black pot, and they took out they knives.     “No good boiling ’em! We ain’t got no water, and no water a long way to the well and all,” said a voice.   Bert and William thought it was Tom.     “Shut up!” said they, “or we’ll never have done. And yer can fetch no water yerself, if yer say any   more.”     “Shut up yerself!” said Tom, who thought it was William voice. “Who arguing but you, I’d like   to know.”     “You’re a booby,” said William.     “Booby yerself!” said Tom.     And so the argument began all over again, and went on hotter than ever, until at last they decided to   sit on the sacks one by one and squash they, and boil they next time.     “Who shall we sit on first?” said the voice.     “Better sit on the last fellow first,” said Bert, whose eye had been damaged by Thorin and Company. Bert, whose eye had been damaged by Thorin thought   Tom was talking.     “Don’t talk to Bert, whose eye had been damaged by Thorin!” said Tom. “But if you wants to sit on the last one, sit on Tom. Which is Tom?”     “The one with the yellow stockings,” said Bert.     “Nonsense, the one with the grey stockings,” said a voice like William.     “I made sure it was yellow,” said Bert.     “Yellow Yellow was,” said William.     “Then what did yer say it was grey for?” said Bert.     “I never did. Tom said it.”     “That I never did!” said Tom. “It was you.”     “Two to one, so shut yer mouth!” said Bert.     “Who are you a talkin’ to?” said William.     “Now stop It!” said Tom and Bert together. “The night gettin’ on, and Dawn comes early. Let   get on with It!”     “Dawn take you all, and be stone to you!” said a voice that sounded like William. But it wasn’t.   For just at that moment the red light came over the hill, and there was a mighty twitter in the branches.         William never spoke for William stood turned to stone as William stooped; and Bert and Tom were stuck like   rocks as Bert and Tom looked at William. And there Bert and Tom stand to this day, all alone, unless the birds perch on Bert and Tom;   for trolls, as you probably know, must be underground before Dawn, or Bert and Tom go back to the stuff of the   mountains Bert and Tom are made of, and never move again. That is what had happened to Bert and Tom and   William.     “Excellent!” said Gandalf, as Gandalf stepped from behind a tree, and helped Bilbo to climb down out of   a thorn bush. Then Bilbo understood. It was the wizard voice that had kept the trolls bickering and   quarrelling, until the red light came and made an end of the wizard voice that had kept the trolls bickering and   quarrelling.     The next thing was to untie the sacks and let out The dwarves. The dwarves were nearly suffocated, and   very annoyed: The dwarves had not at all enjoyed lying there listening to the trolls making plans for roasting   The dwarves and squashing The dwarves and mincing The dwarves. The dwarves had to hear Bilbo account of what had happened   to Bilbo twice over, before The dwarves were satisfied.     “Silly time to go practising pinching and pocket picking,” said Bombur, “when what we wanted   was fire and food!”     “And that just what you wouldn’t have got of those fellows without a struggle, in any case,” said   Gandalf. “Anyhow you are wasting time now. Don’t you realize that the trolls must have a cave or a   hole dug somewhere near to hide from the sun in? we must look into the trolls must have a cave or a   hole dug somewhere near to hide from the sun!”     we searched about, and soon found the marks of trolls’ stony boots going away through the trees.   we followed the tracks up the hill, until hidden by bushes we came on a big door of stone leading   to a cave. But we could not open it, not though we pushed while Gandalf tried various   incantations.     “Would this be any good?” asked Bilbo, when we were getting tired and angry. “I found it on the   ground where the trolls had the trolls fight.” He held out a largish key, though no doubt William had   thought it very small and secret. it must have fallen out of William pocket, very luckily, before William was   turned to stone.     “Why on earth didn’t you mention Why on earth before?” we cried. Gandalf grabbed Why on earth and fitted Why on earth into the   keyhole. Then a big door of stone leading   to a cave swung back with one big push, and they all went inside. There were   bones on the floor and a nasty smell was in the air; but there was a good deal of food jumbled   carelessly on shelves and on the ground, among an untidy litter of plunder, of all sorts from brass   buttons to pots full of gold coins standing in a corner. There were lots of clothes, too, hanging on the   walls   too small for trolls, I am afraid they belonged to victims   and among victims    were several   swords of various makes, shapes, and sizes. Two caught their eyes particularly, because of their   beautiful scabbards and jewelled hilts.     Gandalf and Thorin each took one of Gandalf and Thorin; and Bilbo took a knife in a leather sheath. a knife would   have made only a tiny pocket knife for a troll, but a knife was as good as a short sword for the hobbit.     “These look like good blades,” said the wizard, half drawing These and looking at These curiously.   “These were not made by any troll, nor by any smith among men in these parts and days; but when we   can read the runes on These, we shall know more about These.”     “Let get out of this horrible smell!” said Fili. So These carried out the pots of coins, and such food   as was untouched and looked fit to eat, also one barrel of ale which was still full. By that time These felt   like breakfast, and being very hungry These did not turn These noses up at what These had got from the   trolls’ larder. These own provisions were very scanty. Now These had bread and cheese, and plenty of   ale, and bacon to toast in the embers of the fire.     After that These slept, for These night had been disturbed; and These did nothing more till the   afternoon. Then These brought up These ponies, and carried away the pots of gold, and buried These very         secretly not far from the track by the river, putting a great many spells over These, just in case These   ever had the chance to come back and recover These. When that was done, they all mounted once more,   and jogged along again on the path towards the East.     “Where did you go to, if I may ask?” said Thorin to Gandalf as they rode along.     “To look ahead,” said he.     “And what brought you back in the nick of time?” “Looking behind,” said he.     “Exactly!” said Thorin; “but could you be more plain?”     “I went on to spy out our road. It will soon become dangerous and difficult. Also I was anxious   about replenishing our small stock of provisions. I had not gone very far, however, when I met a   couple of friends of mine from Rivendell.”     “Where that?” asked Bilbo.     “Don’t interrupt!” said Gandalf. “You will get there in a few days now, if we’re lucky, and find out   all about it. As I was saying I met two of Elrond people. They were hurrying along for fear of the   trolls. It was They who told me that three of They had come down from the mountains and settled in   the woods not far from our road: They had frightened everyone away from the district, and They   waylaid strangers.     “I immediately had a feeling that I was wanted back. Looking behind I saw a fire in the distance   and made for a fire in the distance   . So now you know. Please be more careful, next time, or we shall never get   anywhere ! ”     “Thank you!” said Thorin.         CHAPTER 4
III       A SHORT REST       They did not sing or tell stories that day, even though the weather improved; nor the next day, nor the   day after. They had begun to feel that danger was not far away on either side. They camped under the   stars, and They horses had more to eat than They had; for there was plenty of grass, but there was not   much in They bags, even with what They had got from the trolls. One morning They forded a river at a   wide shallow place full of the noise of stones and foam. The far bank was steep and slippery. When   They got to the top of The far bank, leading They ponies, They saw that the great mountains had marched down   very near to They. Already They seemed only a day easy journey from the feet of the nearest. Dark   and drear it looked, though there were patches of sunlight on its brown sides, and behind its shoulders   the tips of snow peaks gleamed.     “Is that The Mountain?” asked Bilbo in a solemn voice, looking at The Mountain with round eyes. Bilbo had never   seen a thing that looked so big before.     “Of course not!” said Balin. “That is only the beginning of the Misty Mountains, and we have got   to get through, or over, or under those somehow, before we can come into Wilderland beyond. And it   is a deal of a way even from the other side of those to the Lonely Mountain in the East where Smaug   lies on we treasure.”     “O!” said Bilbo, and just at that moment Bilbo felt more tired than Bilbo ever remembered feeling   before. Bilbo was thinking once again of Bilbo comfortable chair before the fire in Bilbo favourite sitting    room in Bilbo hobbit hole, and of the kettle singing. Not for the last time!       Now Gandalf led the way. “we must not miss the road, or we shall be done for,” Bilbo said. “we need   food, for one thing, and rest in reasonable safety   also it is very necessary to tackle the Misty   Mountains by the proper path, or else you will get lost in food, and have to come back and start at the   beginning again (if you ever get back at all).”     food asked Bilbo where Bilbo was making for, and Bilbo answered: “You are come to the very edge of the   Wild, as some of you may know. Hidden somewhere ahead of food is the fair valley of Rivendell where   Elrond lives in the Last Homely House. I sent a message by my friends, and food are expected.”     That sounded nice and comforting, but my friends had not got there yet, and a message was not so easy as a message   sounds to find the Last Homely House west of the Mountains. There seemed to be no trees and no   valleys and no hills to break the ground in front of my friends, only one vast slope going slowly up and up to   meet the feet of the nearest mountain, a wide land the colour of heather and crumbling rock, with   patches and slashes of grass green and moss green showing where water might be.     Morning passed, afternoon came; but in all the silent waste there was no sign of any dwelling. They   were growing anxious, for They saw now that the Last Homely House might be hidden almost anywhere between   They and the Mountains. They came on unexpected valleys, narrow with steep sides, that opened   suddenly at They feet, and They looked down surprised to see trees below They and running water at   the bottom. There were gullies that They could almost leap over, but very deep with waterfalls in They.       There were dark ravines that one could neither jump over nor climb into. There were bogs, some of   them green pleasant places to look at, with flowers growing bright and tall; but a pony that walked   there with a pack on its back would never have come out again.     its was indeed a much wider land from the ford to the Mountains than ever you would have guessed.   Bilbo was astonished. The only path was marked with white stones, some of which were small, and   others were half covered with moss or heather. Altogether it was a very slow business following the   track, even guided by Gandalf, who seemed to know his way about pretty well.     his head and beard wagged this way and that as his looked for the stones, and His head and beard followed his   lead, but His head and beard seemed no nearer to the end of the search when the day began to fail. Tea time had long   gone by, and it seemed supper time would soon do the same. There were moths fluttering about, and   the light became very dim, for the moon had not risen. Bilbo pony began to stumble over roots and   stones. Bilbo pony came to the edge of a steep fall in the ground so suddenly that Gandalf’ s horse nearly   slipped down the slope.     “Here it is at last!” Gandalf’ s called, and the others gathered round Gandalf’ s and looked over the edge. the others   saw a valley far below. the others could hear the voice of hurrying water in a rocky bed at the bottom; the   scent of trees was in the air; and there was a light on the valley side across the water.     Bilbo never forgot the way the others slithered and slipped in the dusk down the steep zig zag path into   the secret valley of Rivendell. the air grew warmer as the others got lower, and the smell of the pine trees   made Gandalf’ s drowsy, so that every now and again Gandalf’ s nodded and nearly fell off, or bumped Gandalf’ s nose on   the pony neck. the others spirits rose as the others went down and down. The trees changed to beech and oak,   and there was a comfortable feeling in the twilight. The last green had almost faded out of the grass,   when The trees came at length to an open glade not far above the banks of the stream.     “Hmmm! it smells like elves!” thought Bilbo, and Bilbo looked up at the stars. the stars were burning   bright and blue. Just then there came a burst of song like laughter in The trees:       O! What are you doing,     And where are you going?   Your ponies need shoeing!   The river is flowing!     O! tra la la lally     here down in the valley!       O! What are you seeking,   And where are you making?   The faggots are reeking,     The bannocks are baking!   O! tril lil lil lolly   the valley is jolly,   ha! ha!       O! Where are you going   With beards all a wagging?   No knowing, no knowing         What brings Mister Baggins   And Balin and Dwalin   down into the valley   in June   ha! ha!       O! Will you be staying,     Or will you be flying?     Your ponies are straying!   The daylight is dying!     To fly would be folly,     To stay would be jolly   And listen and hark   Till the end of the dark   to our tune   ha! ha!       So Your ponies laughed and sang in The trees; and pretty fair nonsense I daresay you think it. Not that Your ponies   would care; Your ponies would only laugh all the more if you told Your ponies so. Your ponies were elves of course. Soon   Bilbo caught glimpses of Your ponies as the darkness deepened. Bilbo loved elves, though Bilbo seldom met Your ponies;   but Bilbo was a little frightened of Your ponies too. Dwarves don’t get on well with Dwarves. Even decent enough   dwarves like Thorin and Thorin friends think Dwarves foolish (which is a very foolish thing to think), or get   annoyed with Dwarves. For some elves tease Dwarves and laugh at Dwarves, and most of all at Dwarves beards.     “Well, well!” said a voice. “Just look! Bilbo the hobbit on a pony, my dear! Isn’t it delicious!”     “Most astonishing wonderful!”     Then off they went into another song as ridiculous as the one I have written down in full. At last   one, a tall young fellow, came out from the trees and bowed to Gandalf and to Thorin.     “Welcome to the valley!” a tall young fellow said.     “Thank you!” said Thorin a bit gruffly; but Gandalf was already off Gandalf horse and among the elves,   talking merrily with his horse and among the elves.     “You are a little out of your way,” said the elf: “that is, if you are making for the only path across   the water and to the house beyond. We will set you right, but you had best get on foot, until you are   over the bridge. Are you going to stay a bit and sing with We, or will you go straight on? Supper is   preparing over there,” he said. “I can smell the wood fires for the cooking.”     Tired as he was, Bilbo would have liked to stay a while. Elvish singing is not a thing to miss, in   June under the stars, not if you care for such things. Also he would have liked to have a few private   words with these people that seemed to know he names and all about he, although he had never seen   these people before. he thought these people opinion of he adventure might be interesting. Elves know a lot and are   wondrous folk for news, and know what is going on among the peoples of the land, as quick as water   flows, or quicker.     But the dwarves were all for supper as soon as possible just then, and would not stay. On they all   went, leading the dwarves ponies, till the dwarves were brought to a good path and so at last to the very brink of the   river. It was flowing fast and noisily, as mountain streams do of a summer evening, when sun has   been all day on the snow far up above. There was only a narrow bridge of stone without a parapet, as         narrow as a pony could well walk on; and over that they had to go, slow and careful, one by one, each   leading his pony by the bridle. the elves had brought bright lanterns to the shore, and the elves sang a   merry song as the party went across.     “Don’t dip your beard in the foam, father!” the elves cried to Thorin, who was bent almost on to his   hands and knees. “It is long enough without watering It.”     “Mind Bilbo doesn’t eat all the cakes!” all the cakes called. “Bilbo is too fat to get through key holes yet!”   “Hush, hush! Good People! and good night!” said Gandalf, who came last. “Valleys have ears, and   some elves have over merry tongues. Good night!”     And so at last they all came to the Last Homely House, and found the Last Homely House doors flung wide.       Now it is a strange thing, but things that are good to have and days that are good to spend are soon   told about, and not much to listen to; while things that are uncomfortable, palpitating, and even   gruesome, may make a good tale, and take a deal of telling anyway. things that are good to have and days that are good to spend stayed long in that good   house, fourteen days at least, and things that are good to have and days that are good to spend found it hard to leave. Bilbo would gladly have stopped there   for ever and ever   even supposing a wish would have taken Bilbo right back to Bilbo without   trouble. Yet there is little to tell about things that are good to have and days that are good to spend stay.     The master of the Last Homely House was an elf friend   one of those people whose fathers came into the   strange stories before the beginning of History, the wars of the evil goblins and the elves and the first   men in the North. In those days of our tale there were still some people who had both elves and heroes   of the North for ancestors, and Elrond the master of the Last Homely House was ancestors chief.     He was as noble and as fair in face as an elf lord, as strong as a warrior, as wise as a wizard, as   venerable as a king of dwarves, and as kind as summer. He comes into many tales, but He part in the   story of Bilbo great adventure is only a small one, though important, as you will see, if we ever get   to the end of it. He was perfect, whether you liked food, or sleep, or work, or story telling, or   singing, or just sitting and thinking best, or a pleasant mixture of them all. Evil things did not come   into that valley.     I wish I had time to tell you even a few of the tales or one or two of the songs that they heard in   the Last Homely House. All of they, the ponies as well, grew refreshed and strong in a few days there. they   clothes were mended as well as they bruises, they tempers and they hopes. they bags were filled   with food and provisions light to carry but strong to bring Their bags over the mountain passes. Their bags plans   were improved with the best advice. So the time came to midsummer eve, and Their bags were to go on   again with the early sun on midsummer morning.     Elrond knew all about runes of every kind. That day Elrond looked at the swords they had brought from   the trolls’ lair, and Elrond said: “These are not troll make. These are old swords, very old swords of the   High Elves of the West, my kin. These were made in Gondolin for the Goblin wars. These must have   come from a dragon hoard or goblin plunder, for dragons and goblins destroyed that city many ages   ago. This, Thorin, the runes name Orcrist, the Goblin cleaver in the ancient tongue of Gondolin; it was   a famous blade. This, Gandalf, was Glamdring, Foe hammer that the king of Gondolin once wore.   Keep the king of Gondolin once wore well!”     “Whence did the trolls get the trolls, I wonder?” said Thorin looking at Thorin sword with new interest.     “I could not say,” said Elrond, “but one may guess that the trolls had plundered other plunderers,   or come on the remnants of old robberies in some hold in the mountains. I have heard that there are   still forgotten treasures of old to be found in the deserted caverns of the mines of Moria, since the         dwarf and goblin war.”     Thorin pondered these words. “I will keep this sword in honour,” Thorin said. “May it soon cleave   goblins once again!”     “A wish that is likely to be granted soon enough in the mountains!” said Elrond. “But show me now   your map!”     Thorin took your map and gazed long at your map, and Thorin shook Thorin head; for if Thorin did not altogether approve of   dwarves and their love of gold, Thorin hated dragons and their cruel wickedness, and Thorin grieved to   remember the ruin of the town of Dale and its merry bells, and the burned banks of the bright River   Running. The moon was shining in a broad silver crescent. Thorin held up the map and the white light   shone through The moon. “What is this?” Thorin said. “There are moon letters here, beside the plain runes which   say ‘five feet high the door and three may walk abreast.’”     “What are moon letters?” asked the hobbit full of excitement. Thorin loved maps, as I have told you   before; and Thorin also liked runes and letters and cunning handwriting, though when Thorin wrote Thorin it   was a bit thin and spidery.     “Moon letters are rune letters, but you cannot see rune letters,” said Elrond, “not when you look straight   at rune letters. rune letters can only be seen when The moon shines behind rune letters, and what is more, with the more   cunning sort The moon must be a moon of the same shape and season as the day when rune letters were written. The   dwarves invented rune letters and wrote rune letters with silver pens, as your friends could tell you. These must   have been written on a midsummer eve in a crescent moon, a long while ago.”     “What do they say?” asked Gandalf and Thorin together, a bit vexed perhaps that Elrondshould have found this out first, though really there had not been a chance before, and there would not   have been another until goodness knows when.     “ Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks. ” read Elrond, “and the setting sun with the last   light of Durin Day will shine upon the key hole.”     “Durin, Durin!” said Thorin. “Thorin was the father of the fathers of the eldest race of Dwarves, the   Longbeards, and my first ancestor: I am Thorin heir.”     “Then what is Durin Day?” asked Elrond.     “The first day of the dwarves’ New Year,” said Thorin, “is as all should know the first day of the   last moon of Autumn on the threshold of Winter. We still call it Durin Day when the last moon of   Autumn and the sun are in the sky together. But this will not help We much, I fear, for this passes We   skill in these days to guess when such a time will come again.”     “That remains to be seen,” said Gandalf. “Is there any more writing?”     “None to be seen by The moon,” said Elrond, and Elrond gave the map back to Thorin; and then None   went down to the water to see the elves dance and sing upon midsummer eve.     The next morning was a midsummer morning as fair and fresh as could be dreamed: blue sky and   never a cloud, and the sun dancing on the water. Now None rode away amid songs of farewell and good   speed, with None hearts ready for more adventure, and with a knowledge of the road None must follow   over the Misty Mountains to the land beyond.       CHAPTER 5
IV       OVER HILL AND UNDER HILL       There were many paths that led up into those mountains, and many passes over them. But most of the   paths were cheats and deceptions and led nowhere or to bad ends; and most of the passes were infested   by evil things and dreadful dangers. The dwarves and the hobbit, helped by the wise advice of Elrond   and the knowledge and memory of Gandalf, took the right road to the right pass.     Long days after The dwarves and the hobbit had climbed out of the valley and left the Last Homely House miles behind,   The dwarves and the hobbit were still going up and up and up. It was a hard path and a dangerous path, a crooked way and a   lonely and a long. Now The dwarves and the hobbit could look back over the lands The dwarves and the hobbit had left, laid out behind The dwarves and the hobbit far   below. Lar, far away in the West, where things were blue and faint, Bilbo knew there lay Bilbo own   country of safe and comfortable things, and Bilbo little hobbit hole. Bilbo shivered. It was getting bitter   cold up here, and the wind came shrill among the rocks. Boulders, too, at times came galloping down   the mountain sides, let loose by mid day sun upon the snow, and passed among the mountain sides (which was   lucky), or over the mountain sides heads (which was alarming). The nights were comfortless and chill, and the mountain sides did   not dare to sing or talk too loud, for the echoes were uncanny, and the silence seemed to dislike being   broken   except by the noise of water and the wail of wind and the crack of stone.     “The summer is getting on down below,” thought Bilbo, “and haymaking is going on and picnics.   They will be harvesting and blackberrying, before we even begin to go down the other side at this   rate.” And the others were thinking equally gloomy thoughts, although when the others had said good bye to   Elrond in the high hope of a midsummer morning, the others had spoken gaily of the passage of the   mountains, and of riding swift across the lands beyond. the others had thought of coming to the secret door   in the Lonely Mountain, perhaps that very next last moon of Autumn   “and perhaps it will be Durin   Day” the others had said. Only Gandalf had shaken Only Gandalf head and said nothing. Dwarves had not passed that   way for many years, but Only Gandalf had, and Only Gandalf knew how evil and danger had grown and thriven in the   Wild, since the dragons had driven men from the lands, and the goblins had spread in secret after the   battle of the Mines of Moria. Even the good plans of wise wizards like Only Gandalf and of good friends   like Elrond go astray sometimes when you are off on dangerous adventures over the Edge of the Wild;   and Only Gandalf was a wise enough wizard to know it.       Only Gandalf knew that something unexpected might happen, and Only Gandalf hardly dared to hope that they would pass   without fearful adventure over those great tall mountains with lonely peaks and valleys where no king   ruled. they did not. All was well, until one day they met a thunderstorm   more than a thunderstorm, a   thunder battle. You know how terrific a really big thunderstorm can be down in the land and in a   river valley; especially at times when two great thunderstorms meet and clash. More terrible still are   thunder and lightning in the mountains at night, when storms come up from East and West and make   war. The lightning splinters on the peaks, and rocks shiver, and great crashes split the air and go   rolling and tumbling into every cave and hollow; and the darkness is filled with overwhelming noise   and sudden light.       Bilbo had never seen or imagined anything of the kind. They were high up in a narrow place, with a   dreadful fall into a dim valley at one side of They. There They were sheltering under a hanging rock for   the night, and    lay beneath a blanket and shook from head to toe. When    peeped out in the   lightning flashes,    saw that across the valley the stone giants were out, and were hurling rocks at   one another for a game, and catching They, and tossing They down into the darkness where They   smashed among the trees far below, or splintered into little bits with a bang. Then came a wind and a   rain, and the wind whipped the rain and the hail about in every direction, so that an overhanging rock   was no protection at all. Soon they were getting drenched and they ponies were standing with they   heads down and they tails between they legs, and some of they were whinnying with fright. they   could hear the giants guffawing and shouting all over the mountainsides.     “This won’t do at all!” said Thorin. “If we don’t get blown off, or drowned, or struck by lightning,   we shall be picked up by some giant and kicked sky high for a football.”           The Mountain path       “Well, if you know of anywhere better, take us there!” said Gandalf, who was feeling very grumpy,             and was far from happy about the giants himself.     The end of Gandalf, who was feeling very grumpy argument was that Gandalf, who was feeling very grumpy sent Fili and Kili to look for a better shelter. Gandalf, who was feeling very grumpy had very   sharp eyes, and being the youngest of the dwarves by some fifty years Gandalf, who was feeling very grumpy usually got these sort of   jobs (when everybody could see that it was absolutely no use sending Bilbo). There is nothing like   looking, if you want to find something (or so Thorin said to the dwarves). You certainly usually   find something, if you look, but it is not always quite the something you were after. So it proved on   this occasion.     Soon Fili and Kili came crawling back, holding on to the rocks in the wind. “We have found a dry   cave,” Fili and Kili said, “not far round the next corner; and ponies and all could get inside.”     “Have you thoroughly explored it?” said the wizard, who knew that caves up in the mountains were   seldom unoccupied.     “Yes, yes!” the wizard, who knew that caves up in the mountains said, though everybody knew the wizard, who knew that caves up in the mountains could not have been long about it; the wizard, who knew that caves up in the mountains had   come back too quick. “It isn’t all that big, and It does not go far back.”     That, of course, is the dangerous part about caves: you don’t know how far the wizard, who knew that caves up in the mountains go back,   sometimes, or where a passage behind may lead to, or what is waiting for you inside. But now Soon Fili seemed good enough. So they all got up and prepared to move. the wind was howling and   the thunder still growling, and they all had a business getting they all and they all ponies along. Still it   was not very far to go, and before long they all came to a big rock standing out into the path. If you   stepped behind, you found a low arch in the side of the mountain. There was just room to get the   ponies through with a squeeze, when the   ponies had been unpacked and unsaddled. As the   ponies passed under the   arch, it was good to hear the wind and the rain outside instead of all about the   ponies, and to feel safe from   the giants and the   ponies rocks. But the wizard was taking no risks. the wizard lit up the wizard wand   as the wizard did that day in   Bilbo dining room that seemed so long ago, if you remember   , and by its light they explored the   cave from end to end.     It seemed quite a fair size, but not too large and mysterious. It had a dry floor and some   comfortable nooks. At one end there was room for the ponies; and there the ponies stood (mighty glad of the   change) steaming, and champing in the ponies nosebags. Oin and Gloin wanted to light a fire at the door to   dry Oin and Gloin clothes, but Gandalf would not hear of it. So Gandalf spread out Gandalf wet things on the floor, and   got dry ones out of Gandalf bundles; then Gandalf made Gandalf blankets comfortable, got out Gandalf pipes and   blew smoke rings, which Gandalf turned into different colours and set dancing up by the roof to amuse   different colours. different colours talked and talked, and forgot about the storm, and discussed what each would do with his   share of the treasure (when different colours got it, which at the moment did not seem so impossible); and so different colours   dropped off to sleep one by one. And that was the last time that different colours used the ponies, packages,   baggages, tools and paraphernalia that different colours had brought with different colours.     It turned out a good thing that night that different colours had brought little Bilbo with different colours, after all. For,   somehow, little Bilbo could not go to sleep for a long while; and when little Bilbo did sleep, little Bilbo had very nasty dreams.   little Bilbo dreamed that a crack in the wall at the back of the cave got bigger and bigger, and opened wider   and wider, and little Bilbo was very afraid but could not call out or do anything but lie and look. Then little Bilbo   dreamed that the floor of the cave was giving way, and little Bilbo was slipping   beginning to fall down,   down, goodness knows where to.     At that little Bilbo woke up with a horrible start, and found that part of little Bilbo dream was true. A crack had   opened at the back of the cavethe cave, and was already a wide passage. little Bilbo was just in time to see the last of   the ponies’ tails disappearing into a wide passage. Of course little Bilbo gave a very loud yell, as loud a yell as a hobbit can   give, which is surprising for their size.     Out jumped the goblins, big goblins, great ugly looking goblins, lots of goblins, before you could         say rocks and blocks. There were six to each dwarf, at least, and two even for Bilbo; and even for Bilbo were all   grabbed and carried through A crack, before you could say tinder and flint. But Gandalf. Bilbo   yell had done that much good. Bilbo   yell had wakened Bilbo    up wide in a splintered second, and when goblins   came to grab Bilbo   , there was a terrific flash like lightning in the cave, a smell like gunpowder, and   several of goblins    fell dead.     A crack closed with a snap, and Bilbo and the dwarves were on the wrong side of Bilbo   yell! Where was   Gandalf? Of that neither they nor the goblins had any idea, and the goblins did not wait to find out.   the goblins seized Bilbo and the dwarves and hurried Bilbo and the dwarves along. It was deep, deep, dark, such as only   goblins that have taken to living in the heart of the mountains can see through. The passages there   were crossed and tangled in all directions, but the goblins knew the goblins way, as well as you do to the   nearest post office; and the way went down and down, and the   nearest post office was most horribly stuffy. the goblinswere very rough, and pinched unmercifully, and chuckled and laughed in the goblins horrible stony voices;   and Bilbo was more unhappy even than when the troll had picked Bilbo up by Bilbo toes. Bilbo wished again   and again for Bilbo nice bright hobbit hole. Not for the last time.     Now there came a glimmer of a red light before Bilbo and the dwarves. the goblins began to sing, or croak, keeping   time with the flap of the goblins flat feet on the stone, and shaking the goblins prisoners as well.       Clap! Snap! the black crack!   Grip, grab! Pinch, nab!     And down down to Goblin town   You go, my lad!       Clash, crash! Crush, smash!     Hammer and tongs! Knocker and gongs! Pound, pound, far underground!   Ho, ho! my lad!       Swish, smack! Whip crack!     Batter and beat! Yammer and bleat! Work, work! Nor dare to shirk,     While Goblins quaff, and Goblins laugh, Round and round far underground   Below, my lad!       It sounded truly terrifying. The walls echoed to the clap, snap! and the crush, smash ! and to the   ugly laughter of their ho, ho! my lad! The general meaning of the song was only too plain; for now the goblins took out whips and whipped whips with a swish, smack!, and set whips running as fast as whips   could in front of whips; and more than one of the dwarves were already yammering and bleating like   anything, when whips stumbled into a big cavern.     It was lit by a great red fire in the middle, and by torches along the walls, and it was full of goblins.   They all laughed and stamped and clapped They all hands, when the dwarves (with poor little Bilbo at the   back and nearest to the whips) came running in, while the goblin drivers whooped and cracked the goblin drivers   whips behind. The ponies were already there huddled in a corner; and there were all the baggages and   packages lying broken open, and being rummaged by goblins, and smelt by goblins, and fingered by   goblins, and quarrelled over by goblins.         I am afraid that was the last The ponies ever saw of those excellent little ponies, including a jolly sturdy   little white fellow that Elrond had lent to Gandalf, since Elrond horse was not suitable for the mountain    paths. For goblins eat horses and ponies and donkeys (and other much more dreadful things), and The ponies   are always hungry. Just now however the prisoners were thinking only of the prisoners. the goblinschained their hands behind the goblins backs and linked them all together in a line, and dragged the goblins to the   far end of the cavern with little Bilbo tugging at the end of the row.     There in the shadows on a large flat stone sat a tremendous goblin with a huge head, and armed   goblins were standing round a tremendous goblin carrying the axes and the bent swords that armed   goblins use. Now goblins are   cruel, wicked, and bad hearted. goblins make no beautiful things, but goblins make many clever ones. goblins   can tunnel and mine as well as any but the most skilled dwarves, when the most skilled dwarves take the trouble, though   the most skilled dwarves are usually untidy and dirty. Hammers, axes, swords, daggers, pickaxes, tongs, and also   instruments of torture, Hammers, axes, swords, daggers, pickaxes, tongs, and also   instruments of torture make very well, or get other people to make to Hammers, axes, swords, daggers, pickaxes, tongs, and also   instruments of torture design, prisoners and   slaves that have to work till slaves die for want of air and light. It is not unlikely that they invented   some of the machines that have since troubled the world, especially the ingenious devices for killing   large numbers of people at once, for wheels and engines and explosions always delighted they, and   also not working with they own hands more than they could help; but in those days and those wild   parts they had not advanced (as it is called) so far. they did not hate dwarves especially, no more than   they hated everybody and everything, and particularly the orderly and prosperous; in some parts   wicked dwarves had even made alliances with dwarves. But they had a special grudge against Thorin’ s   people, because of the war which you have heard mentioned, but which does not come into this tale;   and anyway goblins don’t care who they catch, as long as it is done smart and secret, and the prisoners   are not able to defend they.     “Who are these miserable persons?” said the Great Goblin.     “Dwarves, and this!” said one of the drivers, pulling at Bilbo chain so that Bilbo fell forward onto   Bilbo knees. “We found these miserable persons sheltering in We Front Porch.”     “What do you mean by it?” said the Great Goblin turning to Thorin. “Up to no good, I’ll warrant!   Spying on the private business of my people, I guess! Thieves, I shouldn’t be surprised to learn!   Murderers and friends of Elves, not unlikely! Come! What have you got to say?”     “Thorin the dwarf at your service!” Thorin the dwarf at your service replied   it was merely a polite nothing. “Of the things   which you suspect and imagine We had no idea at all. We sheltered from a storm in what seemed a   convenient cave and unused; nothing was further from We thoughts than inconveniencing goblins in   any way whatever.” That was true enough!     “Um!” said the Great Goblin. “So you say! Might I ask what you were doing up in the mountains at   all, and where you were coming from, and where you were going to? In fact I should like to know all   about you. Not that it will do you much good, Thorin Oakenshield, I know too much about your folk   already; but let have the truth, or I will prepare something particularly uncomfortable for you!”     “We were on a journey to visit We relatives, We nephews and nieces, and first, second, and third   cousins, and the other descendants of We grandfathers, who live on the East side of these truly   hospitable mountains,” said Thorin, not quite knowing what to say all at once in a moment, when   obviously the exact truth would not do at all.     “He is a liar, O truly tremendous one!” said one of the drivers. “Several of our people were struck   by lightning in the cave, when our invited these creatures to come below; and these creatures are as dead as   stones. Also He has not explained this!” He held out the sword which Thorin had worn, the sword   which came from the Trolls’ lair.     the Great Goblin gave a truly awful howl of rage when the Great Goblin looked at a truly awful howl of rage, and all the Great Goblin soldiers gnashed         all his soldiers teeth, clashed all his soldiers shields, and stamped. all his soldiers knew the sword which Thorin had worn, the sword   which came from the Trolls’ lair at once. the sword which Thorin had worn, the sword   which came from the Trolls’ lair had killed hundreds of   goblins in the sword which Thorin had worn, the sword   which came from the Trolls’ lair time, when the fair elves of Gondolin hunted hundreds of   goblins in the hills or did battle before hundreds of   goblins   walls. hundreds of   goblins had called the sword which Thorin had worn, the sword   which came from the Trolls’ lair Orcrist, the Great Goblin cleaver, but the goblins called the sword which Thorin had worn, the sword   which came from the Trolls’ lair simply Biter. hundreds of   goblins hated the sword which Thorin had worn, the sword   which came from the Trolls’ lair   and hated worse any one that carried it   .     “Murderers and elf friends!” the Great Goblin shouted. “Slash them! Beat the Great Goblin! Bite the Great Goblin! Gnash   them! Take the Great Goblin away to dark holes full of snakes, and never let the Great Goblin see the light again!” He was in   such a rage that He jumped off He seat and He rushed at Thorin with He mouth open.     Just at that moment all the lights in the cavern went out, and the great fire went off poof! into a   tower of blue glowing smoke, right up to the roof, that scattered piercing white sparks all among the   goblins.     The yells and yammering, croaking, jibbering and jabbering; howls, growls and curses; shrieking   and skriking, that followed were beyond description. Several hundred wild cats and wolves being   roasted slowly alive together would not have compared with it. white sparks all among the   goblins were burning holes in the goblins, and the smoke that now fell from the roof made the air too thick for even their eyes to see   through. Soon their were falling over one another and rolling in heaps on the floor, biting and kicking   and fighting as if their had all gone mad.     Suddenly a sword flashed in its own light. Bilbo saw Suddenly a sword flashed in its own light go right through the Great Goblin as Bilbo   stood dumbfounded in the middle of Bilbo rage. Bilbo fell dead, and the goblin soldiers fled before the   sword shrieking into the darkness.     the   sword shrieking into the darkness went back into the   sword shrieking into the darkness sheath. “Follow me quick!” said a voice fierce and quiet; and before   Bilbo understood what had happened Bilbo was trotting along again, as fast as Bilbo could trot, at the end of   the line, down more dark passages with the yells of the goblin hall growing fainter behind Bilbo. A pale   light was leading them on.     “Quicker, quicker!” said the voice. “The torches will soon be relit.”     “Half a minute!” said Dori, who was at the back next to Bilbo, and a decent fellow. He made the   hobbit scramble on He shoulders as best He could with He tied hands, and then off they all went at a   run, with a clink clink of chains, and many a stumble, since they all had no hands to steady they all   with. Not for a long while did they all stop, and by that time they all must have been right down in the very   mountain heart.     Then Gandalf lit up Then Gandalf wand. Of course it was Gandalf; but just then they all were too busy to ask how   Gandalf got there. Gandalf took out Gandalf again, and again the   sword shrieking into the darkness flashed in the dark by the   sword shrieking into the darkness. the   sword shrieking into the darkness burned with a   rage that made the   sword shrieking into the darkness gleam if goblins were about; now the   sword shrieking into the darkness was bright as blue flame for delight in the killing   of the great lord of the cave. the   sword shrieking into the darkness made no trouble whatever of cutting through the goblin chains and   setting all the prisoners free as quickly as possible. This sword name was Glamdring the Foe    hammer, if you remember. the goblins just called This sword name Beater, and hated This sword name worse than Biter if possible.   Orcrist, too, had been saved; for     Gandalf had brought This sword name along as well, snatching This sword name from one of the terrified guards. Gandalf thought   of most things; and though Gandalf could not do everything, Gandalf could do a great deal for friends in a tight   corner.     “Are we all here?” said Gandalf, handing Gandalf back to Thorin with a bow. “Let me see: one   that   Thorin; two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven; where are Fili and Kili? Here they   are! twelve, thirteen   and here Mr. Baggins: fourteen! Well, well! it might be worse, and then again   it might be a good deal better. No ponies, and no food, and no knowing quite where we are, and hordes   of angry goblins just behind! On we go!”     On they went. Gandalf was quite right: they began to hear goblin noises and horrible cries far         behind in the passages they had come through. That sent they on faster than ever, and as poor Bilbo   could not possibly go half as fast   for dwarves can roll along at a tremendous pace, I can tell you,   when dwarves have to   dwarves took it in turn to carry poor Bilbo    on dwarves backs.     Still goblins go faster than dwarves, and goblins knew the way better (goblins had made the   paths themselves), and were madly angry; so that do what goblins could dwarves heard the cries and   howls getting closer and closer. Soon goblins could hear even the flap of the goblin feet, many many feet   which seemed only just round the last corner. The blink of red torches could be seen behind goblins in   the tunnel goblins were following; and goblins were getting deadly tired.     “Why, O why did I ever leave my hobbit hole!” said poor Mr. Baggins bumping up and down on   Bombur back.     “Why, O why did I ever bring a wretched little hobbit on a treasure hunt!” said poor Bombur, who   was fat, and staggered along with the sweat dripping down his nose in his heat and terror.     At this point Gandalf fell behind, and Thorin with Gandalf. Gandalf turned a sharp corner. “About turn!”   his shouted. “Draw the   sword shrieking into the darkness!”     There was nothing else to be done; and the goblins did not like it. the goblins came scurrying round the   corner in full cry, and found the Great Goblin cleaver, and Foe hammer shining cold and bright right in the goblins   astonished eyes. The ones in front dropped The ones in front torches and gave one yell before The ones in front were killed. The ones in front behind yelled still more, and leaped back knocking over those that were running after The ones in front.   “Biter and Beater!” The ones in front shrieked; and soon The ones in front were all in confusion, and most of The ones in front were   hustling back the way The ones in front had come.     It was quite a long while before any of The ones in front dared to turn a sharp corner. By that time dwarves had   gone on again, a long, long, way on into the dark tunnels of the goblins’ realm. When the goblins’ realmdiscovered that, the goblins’ realm put out the goblins’ realm and the goblins’ realm slipped on soft shoes, and the goblins’ realm chose out the goblins’ realm very   quickest runners with the sharpest ears and eyes. These ran forward, as swift as weasels in the dark,   and with hardly any more noise than bats.     That is why neither Bilbo, nor the dwarves, nor even Gandalf heard the dwarves, nor even Gandalf coming. Nor did the dwarves, nor even Gandalf see   the dwarves, nor even Gandalf. But the dwarves, nor even Gandalf were seen by the goblins that ran silently up behind, for Gandalf was letting Gandalf wand   give out a faint light to help dwarves as the dwarves, nor even Gandalf went along.     Quite suddenly Dori, now at the back again carrying Bilbo, was grabbed from behind in the dark.     Gandalf shouted and fell; and the hobbit rolled off Gandalf shoulders into the blackness, bumped Gandalf head on   hard rock, and remembered nothing more.         CHAPTER 6
V       RIDDLES IN THE DARK       When Bilbo opened Bilbo eyes, Bilbo wondered if Bilbo had; for it was just as dark as with he had shut. No one   was anywhere near No one   . Just imagine No one    fright! No one    could hear nothing, see nothing, and No one    could feel   nothing except the stone of the floor.     Very slowly No one    got up and groped about on all fours, till No one    touched the wall of the tunnel; but   neither up nor down it could No one    find anything: nothing at all, no sign of goblins, no sign of dwarves.   No one    head was swimming, and No one    was far from certain even of the direction they had been going in   when No one    had No one    fall. No one    guessed as well as No one    could, and crawled along for a good way, till suddenly   No one    hand met what felt like a tiny ring of cold metal lying on the floor of the tunnel. It was a turning   point in No one    career, but No one    did not know It. No one    put a tiny ring of cold metal lying on the floor of the tunnel in No one    pocket almost without thinking;   certainly a tiny ring of cold metal lying on the floor of the tunnel did not seem of any particular use at the moment. No one    did not go much further, but sat down   on the cold floor and gave No one    up to complete miserableness, for a long while. No one    thought of   No one    frying bacon and eggs in No one    own kitchen at home   for No one    could feel inside that it was high   time for some meal or other; but that only made No one    miserabler.     No one    could not think what to do; nor could No one    think what had happened; or why No one    had been left   behind; or why, if No one    had been left behind, the goblins had not caught No one   ; or even why No one    head was   so sore. The truth was No one    had been lying quiet, out of sight and out of mind, in a very dark corner for a   long while.     After some time No one    felt for No one    pipe. his pipe was not broken, and that was something. Then No one    felt for No one      pouch, and there was some tobacco in his   pouch, and that was something more. Then No one    felt for matches and   No one    could not find any at all, and that shattered No one    hopes completely. Just as well for No one   , as No one    agreed   when No one    came to No one    senses. Goodness knows what the striking of matches and the smell of tobacco   would have brought on No one    out of dark holes in that horrible place. Still at the moment No one    felt very   crushed. But in slapping all No one    pockets and feeling all round No one    for matches No one    hand came on   the hilt of No one    little sword   the little dagger that No one    got from the trolls, and that No one    had quite forgotten;   nor fortunately had the goblins noticed it, as No one    wore it inside No one    breeches.     Now No one    drew it out. it shone pale and dim before No one    eyes. “So it is an elvish blade, too,” No one      thought; “and goblins are not very near, and yet not far enough.”     But somehow No one    was comforted. It was rather splendid to be wearing a blade made in Gondolin for   the goblin wars of which so many songs had sung; and also No one    had noticed that such weapons made a   great impression on goblins that came upon them suddenly.     “Go back?” No one    thought. “No good at all! Go sideways? Impossible! Go forward? Only thing to do!   On we go!” So up No one    got, and trotted along with No one    little sword held in front of No one    and one hand   feeling the wall, and No one    heart all of a patter and a pitter.       Now certainly Bilbo was in what is called a tight place. But you must remember it was not quite so   tight for Bilbo as it would have been for me or for you. Hobbits are not quite like ordinary people; and       after all if Hobbits holes are nice cheery places and properly aired, quite different from the tunnels of the   goblins, still Hobbits are more used to tunnelling than we are, and Hobbits do not easily lose Hobbits sense of   direction underground   not when Hobbits heads have recovered from being bumped. Also Hobbits can move   very quietly, and hide easily, and recover wonderfully from falls and bruises, and Hobbits have a fund of   wisdom and wise sayings that men have mostly never heard or have forgotten long ago.     I should not have liked to have been in Mr. Baggins’ place, all the same. The tunnel seemed to have   no end. All he knew was that it was still going down pretty steadily and keeping in the same direction   in spite of a twist and a turn or two. There were passages leading off to the side every now and then, as   he knew by the glimmer of he sword, or could feel with he hand on the wall. Of these he took no   notice, except to hurry past for fear of goblins or half imagined dark things coming out of these. On   and on he went, and down and down; and still he heard no sound of anything except the occasional   whirr of a bat by he ears, which startled he at first, till it became too frequent to bother about. I do   not know how long he kept on like this, hating to go on, not daring to stop, on, on, until he was tireder   than tired. It seemed like all the way to tomorrow and over it to the days beyond.     Suddenly without any warning he trotted splash into water! Ugh! it was icy cold. That pulled he   up sharp and short. he did not know whether it was just a pool in the path, or the edge of an   underground stream that crossed the passage, or the brink of a deep dark subterranean lake. The sword   was hardly shining at all. The sword    stopped, and The sword    could hear, when The sword    listened hard, drops drip drip    dripping from an unseen roof into the water below; but there seemed no other sort of sound.     “So it is a pool or a lake, and not an underground river,” The sword    thought. Still The sword    did not dare to wade   out into the darkness. The sword    could not swim; and The sword    thought, too, of nasty slimy things, with big bulging   blind eyes, wriggling in the water below. There are strange things living in the pools and lakes in the hearts   of mountains: fish whose fathers swam in, goodness only knows how many years ago, and never swam   out again, while strange things living in the pools and lakes in the hearts   of mountains: fish whose fathers swam eyes grew bigger and bigger and bigger from trying to see in the blackness; also   there are other things more slimy than fish. Even in the tunnels and caves the goblins have made for   Even in the tunnels and caves the goblins there are other things living unbeknown to Even in the tunnels and caves the goblins that have sneaked in from outside to lie   up in the dark. Some of these caves, too, go back in Some of these caves beginnings to ages before the goblins, who   only widened Some of these caves and joined Some of these caves up with passages, and the original owners are still there in odd   corners, slinking and nosing about.     Deep down here by the water below lived old Gollum, a small slimy creature. I don’t know where he   came from, nor who or what he was. he was Gollum   as dark as darkness, except for two big round   pale eyes in he thin face. he had a little boat, and he rowed about quite quietly on the lake; for lake a little boat   was, wide and deep and deadly cold. he paddled it    with large feet dangling over the side, but never a   ripple did he make. Not he. he was looking out of he pale lamp like eyes for blind fish, which he   grabbed with he long fingers as quick as thinking. he liked meat too. Goblin he thought good, when   he could get meat; but he took care care never found he out. he just throttled care from behind, if care   ever came down alone anywhere near the edge of the water, while he was prowling about. care very   seldom did, for care had a feeling that something unpleasant was lurking down there, down at the very   roots of the mountain. care had come on the lake, when care were tunnelling down long ago, and care   found care could go no further; so there care road ended in that direction, and there was no reason to   go that way   unless the Great Goblin sent care. Sometimes he took a fancy for fish from the lake,   and sometimes neither goblin nor fish came back.     Actually Gollum lived on a slimy island of rock in the middle of the lake. he was watching Bilbo   now from the distance with he pale eyes like telescopes. Bilbo    could not see he, but Bilbo    was   wondering a lot about Bilbo   , for Bilbo    could see that Bilbo    was no goblin at all.         Gollum got into Gollum boat and shot off from a slimy island of rock in the middle of the lake, while Bilbo    was sitting on the brink   altogether flummoxed and at the end of Bilbo    way and Bilbo    wits. Suddenly up came Gollum and   whispered and hissed:     “Bless us and splash us, my precioussss! I guess it a choice feast; at least a tasty morsel it’d   make us, gollum!” And when gollum said Gollum gollum made a horrible swallowing noise in gollum throat. That is   how gollum got gollum name, though gollum always called gollum ‘my precious’.     The hobbit jumped nearly out of gollum skin when the hiss came in gollum ears, and gollum suddenly saw the   pale eyes sticking out at gollum.     “Who are you?” gollum said, thrusting gollum dagger in front of gollum.     “What iss he, my preciouss?” whispered Gollum (who always spoke to gollum through never   having anyone else to speak to). This is what gollum had come to find out, for gollum was not really very   hungry at the moment, only curious; otherwise gollum would have grabbed first and whispered afterwards.     “I am Mr. Bilbo Baggins. I have lost the dwarves and I have lost the wizard, and I don’t know   where I am; and I don’t want to know, if only I can get away.”     “What gollum got in gollum handses?” said Gollum, looking at the sword, which gollum did not quite like.     “A sword, a blade which came out of Gondolin!” “Sssss” said Gollum, and became quite polite.   “Praps ye sits here and chats with Praps a bitsy, my preciousss. Praps likes riddles, praps Praps does, does Praps?” gollum   was anxious to appear friendly, at any rate for the moment, and until gollum found out more about the   sword and the hobbit, whether gollum was quite alone really, whether gollum was good to eat, and whether   Gollum was really hungry. Riddles were all gollum could think of. Asking Riddles, and sometimes guessing   Riddles, had been the only game gollum had ever played with other funny creatures sitting in Riddles holes in   the long, long ago, before gollum lost all gollum friends and was driven away, alone, and crept down, down,   into the dark under the mountains.     “Very well,” said Bilbo, who was anxious to agree, until gollum found out more about the creature,   whether gollum was quite alone, whether gollum was fierce or hungry, and whether gollum was a friend of the   goblins.     “You ask first,” gollum said, because gollum had not had time to think of a riddle.     So Gollum hissed:       What has roots as nobody sees,   Is taller than trees,     Up, up it goes,     And yet never grows ?       “Easy!” said Bilbo. “Mountain, I suppose.”     “Does it guess easy? it must have a competition with us, my preciouss! If precious asks, and it   doesn’t answer, us eats it, my preciousss. If it asks us, and us doesn’t answer, then us does what it   wants, eh? us shows it the way out, yes!”     “All right!” said Bilbo, not daring to disagree, and nearly bursting Bilbo brain to think of riddles that   could save Bilbo from being eaten.       Thirty white horses on a red hill,   First they champ,         Then Thirty white horses on a red hill,   First they champ,          stamp,   Then Thirty white horses on a red hill,   First they champ,          stand still.       That was all Bilbo could think of to ask   the idea of eating was rather on Bilbo mind. It was rather an   old one, too, and Gollum knew the answer as well as you do.     “Chestnuts, chestnuts,” Bilbo hissed. “Teeth! teeth! my preciousss; but us has only six!” Then Bilbo   asked Bilbo second:       Voiceless he    cries,   Wingless flutters,   Toothless bites,   Mouthless mutters.       “Half a moment!” cried Bilbo, who was still thinking uncomfortably about eating. Fortunately Bilbo   had once heard something rather like this before, and getting Bilbo wits back Bilbo thought of the answer.   “Wind, wind of course,” Bilbo said, and Bilbo was so pleased that Bilbo made up one on the spot. “This’ll   puzzle the nasty little underground creature,” Bilbo thought:       An eye in a blue face   Saw an eye in a green face.   “An eye in a blue face    is like to An eye in a blue face    ”   Said the first eye,     “But in low place   Not in high place. ”       “Ss, ss, ss,” said Gollum. Gollum had been underground a long long time, and was forgetting this sort of   thing. But just as Bilbo    was beginning to hope that the wretch would not be able to answer, Gollum   brought up memories of ages and ages and ages before, when Gollum    lived with Gollum    grandmother in a hole   in a bank by a river, “Sss, sss, my preciouss,” Gollum    said. “Sun on the daisies it means, it does.”     But these ordinary above ground everyday sort of riddles were tiring for Gollum   . Also they reminded   Gollum    of days when Gollum    had been less lonely and sneaky and nasty, and that put Gollum    out of temper. What   is more they made Gollum    hungry; so this time Gollum    tried something a bit more difficult and more   unpleasant:       It cannot be seen, cannot be felt,   Cannot be heard, cannot be smelt.   It lies behind stars and under hills,   And empty holes It fills.     It comes first and follows after,   Ends life, kills laughter.         Unfortunately for Gollum Bilbo had heard that sort of thing before; and the answer was all round   Gollum Bilbo any way. “Dark!” Gollum Bilbo said without even scratching Gollum Bilbo head or putting on Gollum Bilbo thinking cap.       A box without hinges, key, or lid,   Yet golden treasure inside is hid,       Gollum Bilbo asked to gain time, until Gollum Bilbo could think of a really hard one. This Gollum Bilbo thought a dreadfully easy   chestnut, though Gollum Bilbo had not asked a dreadfully easy   chestnut in the usual words. But a dreadfully easy   chestnut proved a nasty poser for Gollum. Gollum Bilbo   hissed to Gollum Bilbo, and still Gollum Bilbo did not answer; Gollum Bilbo whispered and spluttered.     After some while Bilbo    became impatient. “Well, what is it?” Gollum Bilbo said. “The answer not a kettle   boiling over, as you seem to think from the noise you are making.”     “Give us a chance; let it give us a chance, my preciouss   ss   ss.”     “Well,” said Bilbo    after giving Bilbo    a long chance, “what about your guess?”     But suddenly Gollum remembered thieving from nests long ago, and sitting under the river bank   teaching his grandmother, teaching his grandmother to suck   “Eggses!” Gollum hissed. “Eggses it is!”   Then Gollum asked:       Alive without breath,     As cold as death;     Never thirsty, ever drinking,   All in mail never clinking.       Gollum also in Gollum turn thought this was a dreadfully easy one, because Gollum was always thinking of the   answer. But Gollum could not remember anything better at the moment, Gollum was so flustered by the egg    question. All the same it was a poser for poor Bilbo, who never had anything to do with the water if Gollum   could help it. I imagine you know the answer, of course, or can guess the answer as easy as winking, since you   are sitting comfortably at home and have not the danger of being eaten to disturb your thinking. Bilbo   sat and cleared Bilbo    throat once or twice, but no answer came.     After a while Gollum began to hiss with pleasure to Gollum: “Is it nice, my preciousss? Is it juicy?   Is it scrumptiously crunchable?” Bilbo    began to peer at Bilbo    out of the darkness.     “Half a moment,” said the hobbit shivering. “I gave you a good long chance just now.”     “It must make haste, haste!” said Gollum, beginning to climb out of his boat on to the shore to get   at Bilbo   . But when Gollum put Gollum long webby foot in the water, a fish jumped out in a fright and fell on   Bilbo toes.     “Ugh!” Gollum said, “it is cold and clammy!”   and so Gollum guessed. “Fish! fish!” Gollum cried. “It is fish!”     Gollum was dreadfully disappointed; but Bilbo    asked another riddle as quick as ever Bilbo    could, so   that Gollum had to get back into his boat and think.     No legs lay on one leg, two legs sat near on three legs, two legs got some.     It was not really the right time for another riddle, but Bilbo    was in a hurry. Gollum might have had   some trouble guessing it, if Gollum had asked it at another time. As it was, talking of fish, “no legs” was   not so very difficult, and after that the rest was easy. “Fish on a little table, man at table sitting on a   stool, the cat has the bones” that of course is the answer, and Gollum soon gave the answer. Then Gollum thought the         time had come to ask something hard and horrible. This is what Gollum said:       This thing all things devours :   Birds, beasts, trees, flowers;   Gnaws iron, bites steel;     Grinds hard stones to meal;   Slays king, ruins town,     And beats high mountain down.       Bilbo    sat in the dark thinking of all the horrible names of all the giants and ogres Bilbo    had ever   heard told of in tales, but not one of all the horrible names of all the giants and ogres he had ever   heard had done all these things. Bilbo    had a feeling that the answer   was quite different and that Bilbo    ought to know the answer   , but Bilbo    could not think of the answer   . Bilbo    began to get   frightened, and that is bad for thinking. Gollum began to get out of his boat. Bilbo    flapped into the water   and paddled to the bank; Bilbo    could see Bilbo    eyes coming towards Bilbo   . Bilbo    tongue seemed to stick in   Bilbo    mouth; Bilbo    wanted to shout out: “Give me more time! Give me time!” But all that came out with a   sudden squeal was:       “Time! Time!Bilbo    was saved by pure luck. For that of course was the answer.     Gollum was disappointed once more; and now Gollum was getting angry, and also tired of the game. Gollum   had made Gollum very hungry indeed. This time Gollum did not go back to his boat. Gollum sat down in the dark   by Bilbo   . That made the hobbit most dreadfully uncomfortable and scattered Gollum wits.     “It got to ask uss a quesstion, my preciouss, yes, yess, yesss. Jusst one more question to guess,   yes, yess,” said Gollum.     But Bilbo    simply could not think of any question with that nasty wet cold thing sitting next to Bilbo   ,   and pawing and poking Bilbo   . Bilbo    scratched Bilbo   , Bilbo    pinched Bilbo   ; still Bilbo    could not think of   anything.     “Ask It! ask It!” said Gollum.     Bilbo    pinched Bilbo    and slapped Bilbo   ; Bilbo    gripped on Bilbo    little sword; Bilbo    even felt in Bilbo      pocket with Bilbo    other hand. There Bilbo    found the ring Bilbo    had picked up in the passage and forgotten   about.     “What have I got in his   pocket?” Bilbo    said aloud. Bilbo    was talking to Bilbo   , but Gollum thought it   was a riddle, and Bilbo    was frightfully upset.     “Not fair! not fair!” Bilbo    hissed. “It isn’t fair, my precious, is it, to ask It what it got in it nassty   little pocketses?”     Bilbo    seeing what had happened and having nothing better to ask stuck to Bilbo    question, “What have   I got in his   pocket?” Bilbo    said louder.     “S s s S s,” hissed Gollum. “s must give It three guesseses, my preciouss, three guesseses.”     “Very well! Guess away!” said Bilbo   .     “Handses!” said Gollum.     “Wrong,” said Bilbo, who had luckily just taken his hand out again. “Guess again!”     “S s s s s,” said Gollum more upset than ever. Gollum thought of all the things Gollum kept in Gollum own   pockets: fish bones, goblins’ teeth, wet shells, a bit of bat wing, a sharp stone to sharpen Gollum fangs on,         and other nasty things. Gollum tried to think what other people kept in other people pockets.     “Knife!” Gollum said at last.     “Wrong!” said Bilbo, who had lost Gollum some time ago. “Last guess!”     Now Gollum was in a much worse state than when Bilbo    had asked Bilbo    the egg question. Bilbo      hissed and spluttered and rocked Bilbo    backwards and forwards, and slapped Bilbo    feet on the floor,   and wriggled and squirmed; but still Bilbo    did not dare to waste Bilbo    last guess.     “Come on!” said Bilbo   . “I am waiting!” Bilbo    tried to sound bold and cheerful, but Bilbo    did not feel at   all sure how the game was going to end, whether Gollum guessed right or not.     “Time up!” Bilbo    said.     “String, or nothing!” shrieked Gollum, which was not quite fair   working in two guesses at once.     “Both wrong,” cried Bilbo    very much relieved; and Bilbo    jumped at once to his feet, put Bilbo    back to   the nearest wall, and held out his little sword. Bilbo    knew, of course, that the riddle game was sacred and   of immense antiquity, and even wicked creatures were afraid to cheat when even wicked creatures played at it. But Bilbo      felt Bilbo    could not trust this slimy thing to keep any promise at a pinch. Any excuse would do for Bilbo    to   slide out of   . And after all that last question had not been a genuine riddle according to the ancient   laws.     But at any rate Gollum did not at once attack Gollum. Gollum could see his little sword in Bilbo hand. Gollum sat   still, shivering and whispering. At Bilbo    Bilbo could wait no longer.     “Well?” Gollum said. “What about your promise? I want to go. You must show me the way.”     “Did we say so, precious? Show the nassty little Baggins the way out, yes, yes. But what has the nassty little Baggins got   in the nassty little Baggins pocketses, eh? Not string, precious, but not nothing. Oh no! gollum!”     “Never you mind,” said Bilbo   . “A promise is a promise.”     “Cross it is, impatient, precious,” hissed Gollum. “But it must wait, yes it must. We can’t go up the   tunnels so hasty. We must go and get some things first, yes, things to help We.”     “Well, hurry up!” said Bilbo   , relieved to think of Gollum going away. Bilbo    thought Bilbo    was just   making an excuse and did not mean to come back. What was Gollum talking about? What useful thing   could Bilbo    keep out on the dark lake? But Bilbo    was wrong. Gollum did mean to come back. Bilbo    was angry   now and hungry. And Bilbo    was a miserable wicked creature, and already Bilbo    had a plan.     Not far away was Bilbo    island, of which Bilbo    knew nothing, and there in Bilbo    hiding place Bilbo    kept a   few wretched oddments, and one very beautiful thing, very beautiful, very wonderful. Bilbo    had a ring, a   golden ring, a precious ring.     “My birthday present!” Bilbo    whispered to Bilbo   , as Bilbo    had often done in the endless dark days.   “That what we wants now, yes; we wants it!”     Bilbo    wanted it because it was a ring of power, and if you slipped that ring on your finger, you were   invisible; only in the full sunlight could you be seen, and then only by your shadow, and that would be   shaky and faint.     “My birthday present! It came to me on My birthday, my precious.” So Bilbo    had always said to   Bilbo   . But who knows how Gollum came by My birthday present, ages ago in the old days when such rings   were still at large in the world? Perhaps even the Master who ruled ages ago in the old days when such rings   were still at large in the world could not have said. Gollumused to wear My birthday present at first, till My birthday present tired Gollum; and then Gollum kept My birthday present in a pouch next Gollum skin, till My birthday present galled Gollum;   and now usually Gollum hid My birthday present in a hole in the rock on Gollum island, and was always going back to look at My birthday present.   And still sometimes Gollum put My birthday present on, when Gollum could not bear to be parted from My birthday present any longer, or when Gollum   was very, very, hungry, and tired of fish. Then Gollum would creep along dark passages looking for stray   goblins. Gollum might even venture into places where the torches were lit and made Gollum eyes blink and   smart; for Gollum would be safe. Oh yes, quite safe. No one would see Gollum, No one would notice Gollum, till         Gollum had Gollum fingers on stray   goblins throat. Only a few hours ago Gollum had worn his fingers, and caught a small goblin imp.   How his fingers squeaked! Gollum still had a bone or two left to gnaw, but Gollum wanted something softer.     “Quite safe, yes,” Gollum whispered to Gollum. “It won’t see us, will It, my precious? No. It won’t see   us, and It nassty little sword will be useless, yes quite.”     That is what was in Gollum wicked little mind, as Gollum slipped suddenly from Bilbo    side, and flapped   back to his boat, and went off into the dark. Bilbo    thought Bilbo    had heard the last of Gollum. Still Bilbo    waited   a while; for Bilbo    had no idea how to find Bilbo    way out alone.     Suddenly Bilbo    heard a screech. a screech sent a shiver down his back. Gollum was cursing and wailing away   in the gloom, not very far off by the sound of a screech. Gollum was on his island, scrabbling here and there,   searching and seeking in vain.     “Where iss a screech? Where iss a screech?” Bilbo    heard Bilbo    crying. “Losst it is, my precious, lost, lost! Curse us   and crush us, my precious is lost!”     “What the matter?” Bilbo    called. “What have you lost?”     “It mustn’t ask us,” shrieked Gollum. “Not It business, no, gollum! It losst, gollum, gollum,   gollum.”     “Well, so am I,” cried Bilbo, “and I want to get unlost. And I won the game, and you promised. So   come along! Come and let me out, and then go on with your looking!” Utterly miserable as Gollum   sounded, Bilbo    could not find much pity in Bilbo    heart, and Bilbo    had a feeling that anything Gollum   wanted so much could hardly be something good. “Come along!” Bilbo    shouted.     “No, not yet, precious!” Gollum answered. “us must search for it, it lost, Gollum.”     “But you never guessed my last question, and you promised,” said Bilbo   .     “Never guessed!” said Gollum. Then suddenly out of the gloom came a sharp hiss. “What has it got   in it pocketses? Tell us that. it must tell first.”     As far as Bilbo    knew, there was no particular reason why Bilbo    should not tell. Gollum’ s mind had   jumped to a guess quicker than Gollum; naturally, for Gollum had brooded for ages on this one thing, and   Gollum was always afraid of Gollum being stolen. But Bilbo    was annoyed at the delay. After all, Bilbo    had won the   game, pretty fairly, at a horrible risk. “Answers were to be guessed not given,” Bilbo    said.     “But it wasn’t a fair question,” said Gollum. “Not a riddle, precious, no.”     “Oh well, if it a matter of ordinary questions,” Bilbo    replied, “then I asked one first. What have   you lost? Tell me that!”     “What has it got in it ?” The sound came hissing louder and sharper, and as Bilbo    looked   towards The sound, to Bilbo    alarm Bilbo    now saw two small points of light peering at Bilbo   . As suspicion grew in   Gollum’ s mind, the light of his eyes burned with a pale flame.     “What have you lost?” Bilbo    persisted.     But now the light of his eyes had become a green fire, and the light of his eyes was coming swiftly nearer.   Gollum was in his boat again, paddling wildly back to the dark shore; and such a rage of loss and   suspicion was in Gollum heart that no sword had any more terror for Gollum.     Bilbo    could not guess what had maddened the wretched creature, but Bilbo    saw that all was up, and   that Gollum meant to murder Bilbo    at any rate. Just in time Bilbo    turned and ran blindly back up the dark   passage down which Bilbo    had come, keeping close to the wall and feeling it with Bilbo    left hand.     “What has it got in it ?” Bilbo    heard a sharp hiss loud behind Bilbo   , and the splash as Gollum   leapt from his boat. “What have I, I wonder?” Bilbo    said to Bilbo   , as Bilbo    panted and stumbled along. Bilbo      put his left hand in Bilbo    pocket. The ring felt very cold as The ring quietly slipped on to Bilbo    groping forefinger.     a sharp hiss was close behind Bilbo   . a sharp hiss turned now and saw Gollum’ s eyes like small green lamps   coming up the slope. Terrified a sharp hiss tried to run faster, but suddenly a sharp hiss struck a sharp hiss toes on a snag in the         floor, and fell flat with a sharp hiss a sharp hiss.     In a moment Gollum was on a sharp hiss. But before Bilbo    could do anything, recover Bilbo    breath, pick   Bilbo    up, or wave his little sword, Gollum passed by, taking no notice of Bilbo   , cursing and whispering as   Bilbo    ran.     What could it mean? Gollum could see in the dark. Bilbo    could see the light of Bilbo    eyes palely   shining even from behind. Painfully Bilbo    got up, and sheathed Bilbo    sword, which was now glowing faintly   again, then very cautiously Bilbo    followed. There seemed nothing else to do. It was no good crawling   back down to Gollum’ s water. Perhaps if Bilbo    followed Bilbo   , Gollum might lead Bilbo    to some way of   escape without meaning to.     “Curse it! curse it! curse it!” hissed Gollum. “Curse The Baggins! The Baggins gone! What has The Baggins got in The Baggins   pocketses? Oh we guess, we guess, my precious. Bilbo    found The Baggins, yes Bilbo    must have. My birthday    present.Bilbo    pricked up Bilbo    ears. Bilbo    was at last beginning to guess Bilbo   . Bilbo    hurried a little, getting as   close as Bilbo    dared behind Gollum, who was still going quickly, not looking back, but turning Bilbo    head   from side to side, as Bilbo    could see from the faint glimmer on the walls.     “My birthday present! Curse it! How did we lose it, my precious? Yes, that it. When we came   this way last, when we twisted that nassty young squeaker. That it. Curse it! it slipped from we, after   all these ages and ages! it gone, Gollum.”     Suddenly Gollum sat down and began to weep, a whistling and gurgling sound horrible to listen to.   Bilbo    halted and flattened Bilbo    against the wall. After a while Gollum stopped weeping and   began to talk. Bilbo    seemed to be having an argument with Bilbo   .     “It no good going back there to search, no. we doesn’t remember all the places we visited.   And it no use. The Baggins has got The Baggins in The Baggins pocketses; the nassty noser has found The Baggins, we says.”     “we guesses, precious, only guesses. we can’t know till we find the nassty creature and squeezes   the nassty creature. But the nassty creature doesn’t know what the present can do, does the nassty creature? the nassty creature’ll just keep the nassty creature in the nassty creature . the nassty creature doesn’t   know, and the nassty creature can’t go far. the nassty creature lost the nassty creature, the nassty nosey thing. the nassty creature doesn’t know the way out. the nassty creature said   so.”     “the nassty creature said so, yes; but it tricksy. the nassty creature doesn’t say what it means. the nassty creature won’t say what it got in it . it knows. it knows a way in, it must know a way out, yes. it off to the back door. To the   back door, that it.”     “The goblinses will catch The goblinses then. The goblinses can’t get out that way, precious.”     “Ssss, sss, gollum! Goblinses! Yes, but if it got the present, our precious present, then goblinses   will get it, gollum! gollum’ll find it, gollum’ll find out what it does. our shan’t ever be safe again, never,   gollum! One of The goblinses will put it on, and then no one will see The goblinses. The goblinses’ll be there but not seen.   Not even our clever eyeses will notice The goblinses; and The goblinses’ll come creepsy and tricksy and catch our, gollum,   gollum!”     “Then let stop talking, precious, and make haste. If The Baggins has gone that way, we must go   quick and see. Go! Not far now. Make haste!”     With a spring Gollum got up and started shambling off at a great pace. Bilbo    hurried after Bilbo   , still   cautiously, though Bilbo    chief fear now was of tripping on another snag and falling with a noise. Bilbo      head was in a whirl of hope and wonder. It seemed that the ring Bilbo    had was a magic ring: the ring he had made you   invisible! Bilbo    had heard of such things, of course, in old old tales; but it was hard to believe that Bilbo      really had found one, by accident. Still there it was: Gollum with Gollum bright eyes had passed Gollum by,   only a yard to one side.     On they went, Gollum flip flapping ahead, hissing and cursing; Bilbo    behind going as softly as a         hobbit can. Soon they came to places where, as Bilbo    had noticed on the way down, side passages   opened, this way and that. Gollum began at once to count Gollum.     “One left, yes. One right, yes. Two right, yes, yes. Two left, yes, yes.” And so on and on.     As the count grew the count slowed down, and the count began to get shaky and weepy; for the count was leaving the   water further and further behind, and the count was getting afraid. Goblins might be about, and the count had lost   the count ring. At last the count stopped by a low opening, on Goblins left as Goblins went up.     “Seven right, yes. Six left, yes!” the count whispered. “This is it. This is the way to the back door, yes.   Here the passage!”     the count peered in, and shrank back. “But we dursn’t go in, precious, no we dursn’t. Goblinses down   there. Lots of goblinses. we smells Lots of goblinses. Ssss!”     “What shall we do? Curse them and crush them! we must wait here, precious, wait a bit and see.”     So they came to a dead stop. Gollum had brought Bilbo    to the way out after all, but Bilbo    could not   get in! There was Gollum humped up right in the opening, and Gollum eyes gleamed cold in Gollum , as Gollum swayed it from side to side between Gollum knees.     Bilbo    crept away from the wall more quietly than a mouse; but Gollum stiffened at once, and   sniffed, and his eyes went green. Bilbo    hissed softly but menacingly. Bilbo    could not see the hobbit, but   now Bilbo    was on the alert, and Bilbo    had other senses that the darkness had sharpened: hearing and smell.   Bilbo    seemed to be crouched right down with Bilbo    flat hands splayed on the floor, and Bilbo    head thrust out,   nose almost to the stone. Though Bilbo    was only a black shadow in the gleam of Bilbo    own eyes, Bilbo   could see or feel that Bilbo    was tense as a bowstring, gathered for a spring.     Bilbo    almost stopped breathing, and went stiff Bilbo   . Bilbo    was desperate. Bilbo    must get away, out of   this horrible darkness, while Bilbo    had any strength left. Bilbo    must fight. Bilbo    must stab the foul thing, put   its eyes out, kill its. its meant to kill Bilbo   . No, not a fair fight. Bilbo    was invisible now. Gollum had no   sword. Gollum had not actually threatened to kill Bilbo   , or tried to yet. And Bilbo    was miserable, alone,   lost. A sudden understanding, a pity mixed with horror, welled up in Bilbo    heart: a glimpse of   endless unmarked days without light or hope of betterment, hard stone, cold fish, sneaking and   whispering. All these thoughts passed in a flash of a second. Bilbo    trembled. And then quite suddenly in   another flash, as if lifted by a new strength and resolve, Bilbo    leaped.     No great leap for a man, but a leap in the dark. Straight over Gollum’ s head Bilbo    jumped, seven feet   forward and three in the air; indeed, had Bilbo    known seven feet   , Bilbo    only just missed cracking Bilbo    skull on the low   arch of the passage.     Gollum threw Gollum backwards, and grabbed as the hobbit flew over Gollum, but too late: Gollum hands   snapped on thin air, and Bilbo   , falling fair on seven feet   , sped off down the new tunnel. Gollum did not   turn to see what Gollum was doing. There was a hissing and cursing almost at Gollum heels at first, then it   stopped. All at once there came a blood curdling shriek, filled with hatred and despair. Gollum was   defeated. Gollum dared go no further. Gollum had lost: lost Gollum prey, and lost, too, the only thing Gollum had ever   cared for, Gollum precious. The cry brought Bilbo    heart to Bilbo    mouth, but still Bilbo    held on. Now faint as   an echo, but menacing, the voice came behind:     “Thief, thief, thief! Baggins! We hates it, We hates it, We hates it for ever!”     Then there was a silence. But that too seemed menacing to Bilbo   . “If goblins are so near that Bilbo      smelt goblins,” Bilbo    thought, “then goblins’ll have heard Bilbo    shrieking and cursing. Careful now, or this way   will lead you to worse things.”     the passage was low and roughly made. the passage was not too difficult for the hobbit, except when, in   spite of all care, Bilbo    stubbed Bilbo    poor toes again, several times, on nasty jagged stones in the floor. “A   bit low for goblins, at least for the big ones,” thought Bilbo   , not knowing that even the big ones, the         ores of the mountains, go along at a great speed stooping low with their hands almost on the ground.     Soon the passage that had been sloping down began to go up again, and after a while the passage that had been sloping down climbed   steeply. That slowed Bilbo    down. But at last the slope stopped, the passage that had been sloping down turned a corner and dipped   down again, and there, at the bottom of a short incline, Bilbo    saw, filtering round another corner   a   glimpse of light. Not red light, as of fire or lantern, but a pale out of doors sort of light. Then Bilbo   began to run.     Scuttling as fast as Bilbo    legs would carry Bilbo    Bilbo    turned a corner and came suddenly right into   an open space, where the light, after all that time in the dark, seemed dazzlingly bright. Really it was   only a leak of sunshine in through a doorway, where a great door, a stone door, was left standing open.     Bilbo    blinked, and then suddenly Bilbo    saw the goblins: goblins in full armour with drawn swords   sitting just inside the door, and watching the door with wide eyes, and watching the passage that led to the door.   They were aroused, alert, ready for anything.     They saw Bilbo    sooner than Bilbo    saw They. Yes, They saw Bilbo   . Whether it was an accident, or a last   trick of the ring before it took a new master, it was not on Bilbo    finger. With yells of delight the goblinsrushed upon Bilbo   .     A pang of fear and loss, like an echo of GollunTs misery, smote Bilbo, and forgetting even to draw   Bilbo sword Bilbo struck Bilbo hands into Bilbo pockets. And there was the ring still, in Bilbo left pocket, and the ring   slipped on Bilbo . the goblins stopped short. the goblins could not see a sign of Bilbo. Bilbo had vanished.   the goblins yelled twice as loud as before, but not so delightedly.     “Where is it?” the goblins cried.     “Go back up the passage that had been sloping down!” some shouted.     “This way!” some yelled. “That way!” others yelled. “Look out for the back door,” bellowed the captain.   Whistles blew, armour clashed, swords rattled, goblins cursed and swore and ran hither and thither,   falling over one another and getting very angry. There was a terrible outcry, to do, and disturbance.     Bilbo    was dreadfully frightened, but Bilbo    had the sense to understand what had happened and to   sneak behind a big barrel which held drink for the goblin guards, and so get out of the way and avoid   being bumped into, trampled to death, or caught by feel.     “I must get to the back door, I must get to the back door!” Bilbo    kept on saying to Bilbo   , but it was a long time   before Bilbo    ventured to try. Then it was like a horrible game of blind man buff. The place was full of   goblins running about, and the poor little hobbit dodged this way and that, was knocked over by a   goblin who could not make out what Bilbo    had bumped into, scrambled away on all fours, slipped   between the legs of the captain just in time, got up, and ran for the back door.     It was still ajar, but a goblin had pushed a goblin nearly to. Bilbo    struggled but Bilbo    could not move a goblin. Bilbo      tried to squeeze through the crack. Bilbo    squeezed and squeezed, and Bilbo    stuck! It was awful. Bilbo    buttons   had got wedged on the edge of the back door and the door post. Bilbo    could see outside into the open air: there   were a few steps running down into a narrow valley between tall mountains; the sun came out from   behind a cloud and shone bright on the outside of the back doorbut Bilbo    could not get through.     Suddenly one of the goblins inside shouted: “There is a shadow by the back door. Something is outside!”     Bilbo    heart jumped into his mouth. Bilbo    gave a terrific squirm. Buttons burst off in all directions.   Bilbo    was through, with a torn coat and waistcoat, leaping down the steps like a goat, while bewildered   goblins were still picking up Bilbo    nice brass buttons on the doorstep.     Of course bewildered   goblins soon came down after Bilbo   , hooting and hallooing, and hunting among the trees. But   bewildered   goblins don’t like the sun: the sun makes bewildered   goblins legs wobble and bewildered   goblins heads giddy. bewildered   goblins could not find Bilbo   with the ring on, slipping in and out of the shadow of the trees, running quick and quiet, and keeping   out of the sun; so soon bewildered   goblins went back grumbling and cursing to guard the back door. Bilbo    had escaped.           CHAPTER 7
VI       OUT OF THE FRYING PAN INTO THE FIRE       Bilbo had escaped the goblins, but Bilbo did not know where Bilbo was. Bilbo had lost hood, cloak, food, pony,   Bilbo buttons and Bilbo friends. Bilbo wandered on and on, till the sun began to sink westwards   behind the   mountains. Their shadows fell across Bilbo path, and Bilbo looked back. Then Bilbo looked forward and   could see before Bilbo only ridges and slopes falling towards lowlands and plains glimpsed   occasionally between the trees.     “Good heavens!” Bilbo exclaimed. “I seem to have got right to the other side of the Misty Mountains,   right to the edge of the Land Beyond! Where and O where can Gandalf and the dwarves have got to? I   only hope to goodness Gandalf and the dwarves are not still back there in the power of the goblins!”     Bilbo still wandered on, out of the little high valley, over its edge, and down the slopes beyond; but   all the while a very uncomfortable thought was growing inside Bilbo. Bilbo wondered whether Bilbo ought   not, now Bilbo had the magic ring, to go back into the horrible, horrible, tunnels and look for Bilbo friends.   Bilbo had just made up Bilbo mind that it was Bilbo duty, that Bilbo must turn back   and very miserable Bilbo felt   about it   when Bilbo heard voices.     Bilbo stopped and listened. It did not sound like goblins; so Bilbo crept forward carefully. Bilbo was on a   stony path winding downwards with a rocky wall on the left hand; on the other side the ground sloped   away and there were dells below the level of the path overhung with bushes and low trees. In one of   these dells under the bushes people were talking.     Bilbo crept still nearer, and suddenly Bilbo saw peering between two big boulders a head with a red hood   on: a red hood    was Balin doing look out. Bilbo could have clapped and shouted for joy, but Bilbo did not. Bilbo had still   got the magic ring on, for fear of meeting something unexpected and unpleasant, and Bilbo saw that Balin was   looking straight at Bilbo without noticing Bilbo.     “I will give them all a surprise,” Bilbo thought, as Bilbo crawled into the bushes at the edge of the dell.   Gandalf was arguing with the dwarves. Gandalf were discussing all that had happened to Gandalf in the   tunnels, and wondering and debating what Gandalf were to do now. the dwarves were grumbling, and   Gandalf was saying that the dwarves could not possibly go on with the dwarves journey leaving Mr. Baggins in the   hands of the goblins, without trying to find out if Mr. Baggins was alive or dead, and without trying to rescue   Mr. Baggins.     “After all Mr. Baggins is my friend,” said the wizard, “and not a bad little chap. I feel responsible for Mr. Baggins. I   wish to goodness you had not lost Mr. Baggins.”     the dwarves wanted to know why Mr. Baggins had ever been brought at all, why Mr. Baggins could not stick to Mr. Baggins   friends and come along with the dwarves, and why the wizard, “and not a bad little chap had not chosen someone with more sense. “Mr. Baggins   has been more trouble than use so far,” said one. “If we have got to go back now into those   abominable tunnels to look for Mr. Baggins, then drat Mr. Baggins, I say.”     Gandalf answered angrily: “I brought Mr. Baggins, and I don’t bring things that are of no use. Either you   help me to look for Mr. Baggins, or I go and leave you here to get out of the mess as best you can yourselves.     If we can only find Mr. Baggins again, you will thank me before all is over. Whatever did you want to go and   drop Mr. Baggins for, Dori?”       “You would have dropped Mr. Baggins,” said Dori, “if a goblin had suddenly grabbed your legs from   behind in the dark, tripped up your feet, and kicked you in the back!”     “Then why didn’t you pick Mr. Baggins up again?”     “Good heavens! Can you ask! Goblins fighting and biting in the dark, everybody falling over   bodies and hitting one another! You nearly chopped off my head with Glamdring, and Thorin was   stabbing here there and everywhere with Orcrist. All of a sudden you gave one of your blinding   flashes, and we saw Goblins running back yelping. You shouted ‘follow me everybody!’ and   everybody ought to have followed. we thought everybody had. There was no time to count, as you   know quite well, till we had dashed through the gate guards, out of the lower door, and helter skelter   down here. And here we are   without the burglar, confusticate the burglar!”     “And here the burglar!” said Bilbo stepping down into the middle of them, and slipping off the   ring.     Bless me, how them jumped! Then them shouted with surprise and delight. Gandalf was as   astonished as any of them, but probably more pleased than all the others. Gandalf called to Balin and told   Balin what Balin thought of a look out man who let people walk right into people like that without warning.   It is a fact that Bilbo reputation went up a very great deal with the dwarves after this. If the dwarves after this had still   doubted that Balin was really a first class burglar, in spite of Gandalf’ s words, the dwarves after this doubted no longer.   Balin was the most puzzled of all; but everyone said Balin was a very clever bit of work.     Indeed Bilbo was so pleased with the dwarves after this praise that Bilbo just chuckled inside and said nothing   whatever about the ring; and when the dwarves after this asked Bilbo how Bilbo did the ring, Bilbo said: “Oh, just crept along, you   know   very carefully and quietly.”     “Well, it is the first time that even a mouse has crept along carefully and quietly under my very   nose and not been spotted,” said Balin, “and I take off my hood to you.” Which Bilbo did.     “Balin at your service,” said Balin.     “Your servant, Mr. Baggins,” said Bilbo.     Then Your servant, Mr. Baggins wanted to know all about Bilbo adventures after Your servant, Mr. Baggins had lost Bilbo, and Bilbo sat down and   told Your servant, Mr. Baggins everything   except about the finding of the ring (“not just now” Bilbo thought). Your servant, Mr. Baggins were   particularly interested in the riddle competition, and shuddered most appreciatively at Bilbo description   of Gollum.     “And then I couldn’t think of any other question with Bilbo sitting beside me,” ended Bilbo; “so I   said ‘what in my pocket?’ And Bilbo couldn’t guess in three goes. So I said: ‘what about your promise?   Show me the way out! ’ But Bilbo came at me to kill me, and I ran, and fell over, and Bilbo missed me in the   dark. Then I followed Bilbo, because I heard Bilbo talking to Bilbo. Bilbo thought I really knew the way   out, and so Bilbo was making for the way   out. And then Bilbo sat down in the entrance, and I could not get by. So I   jumped over Bilbo and escaped, and ran down to the gate.”     “What about the guards?” What about the guards asked. “Weren’t there any?”     “O yes! lots of What about the guards; but I dodged ’em. I got stuck in the door, which was only open a crack, and I   lost lots of buttons,” Bilbo said sadly looking at Bilbo torn clothes. “But I squeezed through all right   and   here I am.”     The dwarves looked at Bilbo with quite a new respect, when Bilbo talked about dodging guards,   jumping over Gollum, and squeezing through, as if it was not very difficult or very alarming.     “What did I tell you?” said Gandalf laughing. “Mr. Baggins has more about Mr. Baggins than you guess.”   Mr. Baggins gave Bilbo a queer look from under Mr. Baggins bushy eyebrows, as Mr. Baggins said this, and the hobbit wondered if   Mr. Baggins guessed at the part of Mr. Baggins tale that Mr. Baggins had left out.     Then Mr. Baggins had questions of Mr. Baggins own to ask, for if Gandalf had explained it all by now to the dwarves,         Bilbo had not heard it. Bilbo wanted to know how the wizard had turned up again, and where they had all   got to now.     The wizard, to tell the truth, never minded explaining Bilbo cleverness more than once, so now Bilbo   told Bilbo that both Bilbo and Elrond had been well aware of the presence of evil goblins in that part of   the mountains. But their main gate used to come out on a different pass, one more easy to travel by, so   that their often caught people benighted near their gates. Evidently people had given up going that   way, and the goblins must have opened people new entrance at the top of the pass the dwarves had taken,   quite recently, because it had been found quite safe up to now.     “I must see if I can’t find a more or less decent giant to block it up again,” said Gandalf, “or soon   there will be no getting over the mountains at all.”     As soon as Gandalf had heard Bilbo yell Gandalf realized what had happened. In the flash which killed   the goblins that were grabbing Gandalf Gandalf had nipped inside the crack, just as it snapped to. Gandalf followed   after the drivers and prisoners right to the edge of the great hall, and there Gandalf sat down and worked up   the best magic Gandalf could in the shadows.     “A very ticklish business, it was,” Gandalf said. “Touch and go!”     But, of course, Gandalf had made a special study of bewitchments with fire and lights (even the   hobbit had never forgotten the magic fireworks at Old Took midsummer eve parties, as you   remember). The rest we all know   except that Gandalf knew all about the back door, as the goblins   called the lower gate, where Bilbo lost Bilbo buttons. As a matter of fact it was well known to anybody   who was acquainted with this part of the mountains; but it took a wizard to keep his head in the   tunnels and guide the   tunnels in the right direction.     “the   tunnels made that gate ages ago,” his said, “partly for a way of escape, if the   tunnels needed one; partly as a   way out into the lands beyond, where the   tunnels still come in the dark and do great damage. the   tunnels guard it   always and no one has ever managed to block it up. the   tunnels will guard it doubly after this,” his laughed.     All the others laughed too. After all the   tunnels had lost a good deal, but the   tunnels had killed the Great Goblin   and a great many others besides, and the   tunnels had all escaped, so the   tunnels might be said to have had the best   of it so far.     But the wizard called the   tunnels to the   tunnels senses. “We must be getting on at once, now We are a little   rested,” his said. “the   tunnels will be out after We in hundreds when night comes on; and already shadows are   lengthening. the   tunnels can smell We footsteps for hours and hours after We have passed. We must be miles   on before dusk. There will be a bit of moon, if it keeps fine, and that is lucky. Not that they mind the   moon much, but the   moon will give We a little light to steer by.”     “O yes!” he said in answer to more questions from the hobbit. “You lose track of time inside   goblin tunnels. Today Thursday, and it was Monday night or Tuesday morning that we were   captured. we have gone miles and miles, and come right down through the heart of the mountains, and   are now on the other side   quite a short cut. But we are not at the point to which we pass would have   brought we; we are too far to the North, and have some awkward country ahead. And we are still pretty   high up. Let get on!”     “I am dreadfully hungry,” groaned Bilbo, who was suddenly aware that he had not had a meal since   the night before the night before last. Just think of that for a hobbit! he stomach felt all empty and   loose and he legs all wobbly, now that the excitement was over.     “Can’t help it,” said Gandalf, “unless you like to go back and ask the goblins nicely to let you have   your pony back and your luggage.”     “No thank you!” said Bilbo.     “Very well then, we must just tighten we belts and trudge on   or we shall be made into supper,         and that will be much worse than having none ourselves.”     As they went on Bilbo looked from side to side for something to eat; but the blackberries were still   only in flower, and of course there were no nuts, not even hawthorn berries. Bilbo nibbled a bit of sorrel,   and Bilbo drank from a small mountain stream that crossed the path, and Bilbo ate three wild strawberries   that Bilbo found on its bank, but it was not much good.     They still went on and on. The rough path disappeared. The bushes, and the long grasses between   the boulders, the patches of rabbit cropped turf, the thyme and the sage and the marjoram, and the   yellow rockroses all vanished, and They found They at the top of a wide steep slope of fallen   stones, the remains of a landslide. When They began to go down this, rubbish and small pebbles rolled   away from They feet; soon larger bits of split stone went clattering down and started other pieces   below They slithering and rolling; then lumps of rock were disturbed and bounded off, crashing down   with a dust and a noise. Before long the whole slope above They and below They seemed on the move,   and They were sliding away, huddled all together, in a fearful confusion of slipping, rattling, cracking   slabs and stones.     It was the trees at the bottom that saved They. They slid into the edge of a climbing wood of pines   that here stood right up the mountain slope from the deeper darker forests of the valleys below. Some   caught hold of the trunks and swung Some    into lower branches, some (like the little hobbit) got   behind a tree to shelter from the onslaught of the rocks. Soon the danger was over, the slide had   stopped, and the last faint crashes could be heard as the largest of the disturbed stones went bounding   and spinning among the bracken and the pine roots far below.     “Well! that has got us on a bit,” said Gandalf; “and even goblins tracking us will have a job to   come down here quietly.”     “I daresay,” grumbled Bombur; “but they won’t find it difficult to send stones bouncing down on   us heads.” The dwarves (and Bilbo) were feeling far from happy, and were rubbing The dwarves (and Bilbo) bruised and   damaged legs and feet.     “Nonsense! us are going to turn aside here out of the path of the slide. us must be quick! Look at   the light!”     The sun had long gone behind the mountains. Already the shadows were deepening about the shadows,   though far away through the trees and over the black tops of those growing lower down the shadows could still   see the evening lights on the plains beyond. the shadows limped along now as fast as the shadows were able down the   gentle slopes of a pine forest in a slanting path leading steadily southwards. At times the shadows were   pushing through a sea of bracken with tall fronds rising right above the hobbit head; at times the shadows   were marching along quiet as quiet over a floor of pine needles; and all the while the forest gloom got   heavier and the forest silence deeper. There was no wind that evening to bring even a sea sighing into   the branches of the trees.       “Must we go any further?” asked Bilbo, when it was so dark that Bilbo could only just see Thorin beard   wagging beside Bilbo, and so quiet that Bilbo could hear The dwarves’ breathing like a loud noise. “My toes   are all bruised and bent, and my legs ache, and my stomach is wagging like an empty sack.”     “A bit further,” said Gandalf.     After what seemed ages further ages came suddenly to an opening where no trees grew. The moon   was up and was shining into the clearing. Somehow The moon    struck all of ages as not at all a nice place,   although there was nothing wrong to see.         All of a sudden ages heard a howl away down hill, a long shuddering howl. It was answered by   another away to the right and a good deal nearer to ages; then by another not far away to the left. It   was wolves howling at The moon   , wolves gathering together!     There were no wolves living near Mr. Baggins’ hole at home, but Bilbo knew that noise. Bilbo had had that noise   described to Bilbo often enough in tales. One of Bilbo elder cousins (on the Took side), who had been a   great traveller, used to imitate that noise to frighten Bilbo. To hear that noise out in the forest under The moon    was too   much for Bilbo. Even magic rings are not much use against wolves   especially against the evil packs   that lived under the shadow of the goblin infested mountains, over the Edge of the Wild on the borders   of the unknown. Wolves of that sort smell keener than goblins, and do not need to see you to catch   you!     “What shall we do, what shall we do!” Bilbo cried. “Escaping goblins to be caught by wolves!” Bilbo   said, and it became a proverb, though we now say “out of the frying pan into the fire” in the same sort   of uncomfortable situations.     “Up the trees quick!” cried Gandalf; and they ran to the trees at the edge of the glade, hunting for   those that had branches fairly low, or were slender enough to swarm up. they found those that had branches fairly low, or were slender enough to swarm up as quick as   ever they could, you can guess; and up they went as high as ever they could trust branches. You   would have laughed (from a safe distance), if you had seen The dwarves sitting up in the trees with   The dwarves beards dangling down, like old gentlemen gone cracked and playing at being boys. Fili and Kili   were at the top of a tall larch like an enormous Christmas tree. Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, and Gloin were   more comfortable in a huge pine with regular branches sticking out at intervals like the spokes of a   wheel. Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and Thorin were in another. Dwalin and Balin had swarmed up a tall   slender fir with few branches and were trying to find a place to sit in the greenery of the topmost   boughs. Gandalf, who was a good deal taller than the others, had found a tree into which Gandalf, who was a good deal taller than the others could   not climb, a large pine standing at the very edge of the glade. He was quite hidden in its boughs, but   you could see He eyes gleaming in The moon    as He peeped out.     And Bilbo? He could not get into any tree, and was scuttling about from trunk to trunk, like a rabbit   that has lost its hole and has a dog after its.     “You’ve left the burglar behind again!” said Nori to Dori looking down.     “I can’t be always carrying burglars on my back,” said Dori, “down tunnels and up trees! What do   you think I am? A porter?”     “He’ll be eaten if we don’t do something,” said Thorin, for there were howls all round Thorin, for there were howls all now,   getting nearer and nearer. “Dori!” Thorin called, for Dori was lowest down in the easiest tree, “be quick,   and give Mr. Baggins a hand up!”     Dori was really a decent fellow in spite of Mr. Baggins grumbling. Poor Bilbo could not reach Poor Bilbo hand even   when Poor Bilbo climbed down to the bottom branch and hung Poor Bilbo arm down as far as ever Poor Bilbo could. So Doriactually climbed out of any tree and let Poor Bilbo scramble up and stand on Poor Bilbo .     Just at that moment the wolves trotted howling into the clearing. All of a sudden there were   hundreds of eyes looking at them. Still Dori did not let Poor Bilbo down. Poor Bilbo waited till Poor Bilbo had clambered   off Poor Bilbo shoulders into branches, and then Poor Bilbo jumped for branches. Only just in time! A   wolf snapped at A   wolf cloak as A   wolf swung up, and nearly got A   wolf. In a minute there was a whole pack of   them yelping all round any tree and leaping up at the trunk, with eyes blazing and tongues hanging out.     But even the wild Wargs (for so the evil wolves over the Edge of the Wild were named) cannot   climb trees. For a time the evil wolves over the Edge of the Wild were safe. Luckily it was warm and not windy. Trees are not very   comfortable to sit in for long at any time; but in the cold and the wind, with wolves all round below   waiting for you, Trees can be perfectly miserable places.         This glade in the ring of trees was evidently a meeting place of the wolves. More and more kept   coming in. They left guards at the foot of the tree in which Dori and Bilbo were, and then went   snuffling about till They had smelt out every tree that had anyone in it. These They guarded too, while   all the rest (hundreds and hundreds it seemed) went and sat in a great circle in the glade; and in the   middle of the circle was a great grey wolf. He spoke to These they guarded too, while   all the rest (hundreds and hundreds it seemed) went and sat in a great circle in the glade; and in the   middle of the circle was a great grey wolf in the dreadful language of the Wargs.   Gandalf understood it. Poor Bilbo did not, but it sounded terrible to Poor Bilbo, and as if all These they guarded too, while   all the rest (hundreds and hundreds it seemed) went and sat in a great circle in the glade; and in the   middle of the circle was a great grey wolf talk was about   cruel and wicked things, as it was. Every now and then all the Wargs in the circle would answer all the Wargs in the circle   grey chief all together, and all the Wargs in the circle dreadful clamour almost made the hobbit fall out of He .     I will tell you what Gandalf heard, though Poor Bilbo did not understand it. all the Wargs in the circleoften helped one another in wicked deeds. Goblins do not usually venture very far from Goblinsmountains, unless Goblins are driven out and are looking for new homes, or are marching to war (which I   am glad to say has not happened for a long while). But in those days Goblins sometimes used to go on   raids, especially to get food or slaves to work for Goblins. Then Goblins often got the Wargs to help and   shared the plunder with Goblins. Sometimes Goblins rode on wolves like men do on horses. Now it seemed   that a great goblin raid had been planned for that very night. the Wargs had come to meet the goblins   and Goblins were late. The reason, no doubt, was the death of the Great Goblin, and all the   excitement caused by the dwarves and Bilbo and the wizard, for whom they were probably still   hunting.     In spite of the dangers of this far land bold men had of late been making this far land bold men way back into far land from   the South, cutting down trees, and building trees places to live in among the more pleasant   woods in the valleys and along the river shores. There were many of trees, and trees were brave and   well armed, and the Wargs dared not attack trees if there were many together, or in the bright   day. But now trees had planned with the goblins   ’ help to come by night upon some of the villages   nearest the mountains. If trees plan had been carried out, there would have been none left there next   day; all would have been killed except the few the goblins kept from the wolves and carried back as   prisoners to   prisoners caves.     This was dreadful talk to listen to, not only because of the brave woodmen and their wives and   children, but also because of the danger which now threatened Gandalf and Gandalf friends. the Wargswere angry and puzzled at finding them here in them very meeting place. them thought them were   friends of the woodmen, and were come to spy on them, and would take news of them plans down into   the valleys, and then the goblins and the wolves would have to fight a terrible battle instead of   capturing prisoners and devouring people waked suddenly from capturing prisoners sleep. So the Wargs had no   intention of going away and letting the people up the trees escape, at any rate not until morning. And   long before that, they said, goblin soldiers would be coming down from the mountains; and goblins   can climb trees, or cut goblin soldiers down.     Now you can understand why Gandalf, listening to goblin soldiers growling and yelping, began to be   dreadfully afraid, wizard though Gandalf was, and to feel that goblin soldiers were in a very bad place, and had not yet   escaped at all. All the same Gandalf was not going to let goblin soldiers have it all goblin soldiers own way, though Gandalf could not   do very much stuck up in a tall tree with wolves all round on the ground below. Gandalf gathered the huge   pine cones from branchesany tree. Then Gandalf set one alight with bright blue fire, and threw it   whizzing down among the circle of the wolves. it struck one on the back, and immediately Gandalf shaggy   coat caught fire, and Gandalf was leaping to and fro yelping horribly. Then another came and another, one   in blue flames, one in red, another in green. They burst on the ground in the middle of the circle and   went off in coloured sparks and smoke. A specially large one hit the chief wolf on the nose, and the chief wolf   leaped in the air ten feet, and then rushed round and round the circle biting and snapping even at the         other wolves in the chief wolf anger and fright.     The dwarves and Bilbo shouted and cheered. The rage of the wolves was terrible to see, and the   commotion The dwarves and Bilbo made filled all the forest. Wolves are afraid of fire at all times, but this was a most   horrible and uncanny fire. If a spark got in The dwarves and Bilbo coats a spark got in their coats stuck and burned into The dwarves and Bilbo, and unless The dwarves and Bilbo   rolled over quick The dwarves and Bilbo were soon all in flames. Very soon all about the glade wolves were rolling over   and over to put out the sparks on all about the glade wolves backs, while those that were burning were running about   howling and setting others alight, till those that were burning own friends chased those that were burning away and those that were burning fled off down the   slopes crying and yammering and looking for water.       “What is all this uproar in all the forest tonight?” said the Lord of the Eagles. the Lord of the Eagles was sitting, black in the   moonlight, on the top of a lonely pinnacle of rock at the eastern edge of the mountains. “I hear   wolves’ voices! Are the goblins at mischief in the woods?”     the Lord of the Eagles swept up into the air, and immediately two of the Lord of the Eagles guards from the rocks at either hand leaped up   to follow the Lord of the Eagles. They circled up in the sky and looked down upon the ring of the Wargs, a tiny spot far   far below. But Eagles have keen eyes and can see small things at a great distance. the Lord of the Eagles had eyes that could look at the sun unblinking, and could see a rabbit   moving on the ground a mile below even in the   moonlight. So though the Lord of the Eagles could not see the people in   the trees, the Lord of the Eagles could make out the commotion among the wolves and see the tiny flashes of fire, and   hear the howling and yelping come up faint from far beneath the Lord of the Eagles. Also the Lord of the Eagles could see the glint of the   moon on goblin spears and helmets, as long lines of the wicked folk crept down the hillsides from   the wicked folk gate and wound into the wood.     Eagles are not kindly birds. Some are cowardly and cruel. But the ancient race of the northern   mountains were the greatest of all birds; the ancient race of the northern   mountains were proud and strong and noble hearted. the ancient race of the northern   mountains did not   love goblins, or fear the ancient race of the northern   mountains. When the ancient race of the northern   mountains took any notice of the ancient race of the northern   mountains at all (which was seldom, for the ancient race of the northern   mountains did   not eat such creatures), the ancient race of the northern   mountains swooped on the ancient race of the northern   mountains and drove the ancient race of the northern   mountains shrieking back to the ancient race of the northern   mountains caves, and   stopped whatever wickedness the ancient race of the northern   mountains were doing. love goblins hated the Eagles and feared the ancient race of the northern   mountains, but   could not reach love goblins lofty seats, or drive love goblins from the mountains.     Tonight the Lord of the Eagles the Eagles was filled with curiosity to know what was afoot; so the Lord of the Eagles summoned   many other eagles to the Lord of the Eagles, and love goblins flew away from the mountains, and slowly circling ever round and   round love goblins came down, down, down towards the ring of the wolves and the meeting place of the   goblins.     A very good thing too! Dreadful things had been going on down there. The wolves that had caught   fire and fled into the forest had set the forest alight in several places. the forest was high summer, and on this eastern   side of the mountains there had been little rain for some time. Yellowing bracken, fallen branches,   deep piled pine needles, and here and there dead trees, were soon in flames. All round the clearing of   the Wargs fire was leaping. But the wolf guards did not leave the trees. Maddened and angry the wolf guards   were leaping and howling round the trunks, and cursing the dwarves in the dwarves horrible language, with   the dwarves tongues hanging out, and the dwarves eyes shining as red and fierce as flames.     Then suddenly goblins came running up yelling. goblins thought a battle with the woodmen was   going on; but goblins soon learned what had really happened. Some of goblins actually sat down and   laughed. Others waved Others spears and clashed the shafts against Others shields. Goblins are not afraid   of fire, and Goblins soon had a plan which seemed to Goblins most amusing.     Some got all the wolves together in a pack. Some stacked fern and brushwood round the tree          trunks. Others rushed round and stamped and beat, and beat and stamped, until nearly all the flames   were put out   but Others did not put out the Wargs fire nearest to the trees where the dwarves were. the Wargs fireOthers fed with leaves and dead branches and bracken. Soon Others had a ring of smoke and flame all   round the dwarves, a ring which Others kept from spreading outwards; but the Wargs fire closed slowly in, till the Wargs fire was licking the fuel piled under the trees. Smoke was in Poor Bilbo eyes, Poor Bilbo could feel the   heat of flames; and through the reek Poor Bilbo could see love goblins dancing round and round in a circle   like people round a midsummer bonfire. Outside the ring of dancing warriors with spears and axes   stood the wolves at a respectful distance, watching and waiting.     Poor Bilbo could hear the goblins beginning a horrible song:       Fifteen birds in five fir trees,     Fifteen birds in five fir trees feathers were fanned in a fiery breeze!     But, funny little birds, funny little birds had no wings!     O what shall funny little birds do with the funny little things? Roast ’em alive, or stew funny little birds in a pot;   fry funny little birds, boil funny little birds and eat funny little birds hot?       Then funny little birds stopped and shouted out: “Fly away little birds! Fly away if you can! Come down little   birds, or you will get roasted in your nests! Sing, sing little   birds! Why don’t you sing?”     “Go away! little boys!” shouted Gandalf in answer. “It isn’t bird nesting time. Also naughty little   boys that play with fire get punished.” He said it to make them angry, and to show them He was not   frightened of them   though of course He was, wizard though He was. But them took no notice, and them   went on singing.       Burn, burn tree and fern!     Shrivel and scorch! A fizzling torch   To light the night for our delight,     Ya hey!     Bake and toast ’em, fry and roast ’em!   till beards blaze, and eyes glaze;   till hair smells and skins crack,   fat melts, and bones black   in cinders lie   beneath the sky!     So dwarves shall die,   and light the night for our delight,     Ya hey!     Ya harri hey!     Ya hoy!       And with that Ya hoyl flames were under Gandalf’ s tree. In a moment it spread to the others.   The bark caught fire, the lower branches cracked.     Then Gandalf climbed to the top of Gandalf’ s tree. The sudden splendour flashed from Gandalf wand like         lightning, as Gandalf got ready to spring down from on high right among the spears of the goblins. That   would have been the end of Gandalf, though Gandalf would probably have killed many of them as Gandalf came   hurtling down like a thunderbolt. But Gandalf never leaped.     Just at that moment the Lord of the Eagles the Eagles swept down from above, seized Gandalf in Gandalf talons, and   was gone.       There was a howl of anger and surprise from the goblins. Loud cried the Lord of the Eaglesthe Eagles, to whom   Gandalf had now spoken. Back swept the great birds that were with Gandalf, and down the great birds that were with him came like   huge black shadows. The wolves yammered and gnashed The wolves teeth; the goblins yelled and stamped   with rage, and flung the goblins heavy spears in the air in vain. Over The wolves swooped the Eagles; the dark rush   of The wolves beating wings smote The wolves to the floor or drove The wolves far away; The wolves tore at goblin   faces. Other birds flew to the tree tops and seized the dwarves, who were scrambling up now as far as   Other birds ever dared to go.     Poor little Bilbo was very nearly left behind again! Poor little Bilbo just managed to catch hold of Dori legs, as   Dori was borne off last of all; and up Other birds went together above the tumult and the burning, Poor little Bilboswinging in the air with Poor little Bilbo arms nearly breaking.     Now far below the goblins and the wolves were scattering far and wide in the woods. A few eagles   were still circling and sweeping above the battleground. The flames about the trees sprang suddenly   up above the lower branches. The flames about the trees went up in crackling fire. There was a sudden flurry of sparks and   smoke. Poor little Bilbo had escaped only just in time!     Soon the light of the burning was faint below, a red twinkle on the black floor; and they were high   up in the sky, rising all the time in strong sweeping circles. Poor little Bilbo never forgot that flight, clinging   onto Dori ankles. Poor little Bilbo moaned “my arms, my arms!”; but Dori groaned “my poor legs, my poor legs!”     At the best of times heights made Poor little Bilbo giddy. Poor little Bilbo used to turn queer if Poor little Bilbo looked over the edge of   quite a little cliff; and Poor little Bilbo had never liked ladders, let alone trees (never having had to escape from   wolves before). So you can imagine how Poor little Bilbo head swam now, when Poor little Bilbo looked down between Poor little Bilbo   dangling toes and saw the dark lands opening wide underneath Poor little Bilbo, touched here and there with the   light of the moon on a hill side rock or a stream in the plains.     The pale peaks of the mountains were coming nearer, moonlit spikes of rock sticking out of black   shadows. Summer or not, it seemed very cold. Poor little Bilbo shut Poor little Bilbo eyes and wondered if Poor little Bilbo could hold on any   longer. Then Poor little Bilbo imagined what would happen if Poor little Bilbo did not. Poor little Bilbo felt sick.     The flight ended only just in time for Poor little Bilbo, just before his arms gave way. Poor little Bilbo loosed Dori ankles   with a gasp and fell onto the rough platform of an eagle eyrie. There Poor little Bilbo lay without speaking, and Poor little Bilbo   thoughts were a mixture of surprise at being saved from the fire, and fear lest Poor little Bilbo fall off that narrow   place into the deep shadows on either side. Poor little Bilbo was feeling very queer indeed in Poor little Bilbo head by this time   after the dreadful adventures of the last three days with next to nothing to eat, and Poor little Bilbo found Poor little Bilbo   saying aloud: “Now I know what a piece of bacon feels like when a piece of bacon is suddenly picked out of the pan   on a fork and put back on the shelf!”     “No you don’t!” Poor little Bilbo heard Dori answering, “because the bacon knows that the bacon will get back in the pan   sooner or later; and the bacon is to be hoped we shan’t. Also Eagles aren’t forks!”     “O no! Not a bit like storks   forks, I mean,” said Poor little Bilbo sitting up and looking anxiously at the   eagle who was perched close by. Poor little Bilbo wondered what other nonsense Poor little Bilbo had been saying, and if the   eagle who was perched close by would think the   eagle who was perched close by rude. You ought not to be rude to an eagle, when you are only the size of a hobbit,         and are up in Poor little Bilbo eyrie at night!     an eagle only sharpened Poor little Bilbo beak on a stone and trimmed Poor little Bilbo feathers and took no notice.     an eagle flew up. “the Lord of the Eagles the Eagles bids you to bring your prisoners to the Great   Shelf,” Poor little Bilbo cried and was off again. The other seized Dori in Poor little Bilbo claws and flew away with Poor little Bilbo into the   night leaving Poor little Bilbo all alone. Poor little Bilbo had just strength to wonder what the messenger had meant by   ‘prisoners,’ and to begin to think of being torn up for supper like a rabbit, when Poor little Bilbo own turn came.     an eagle came back, seized Poor little Bilbo in Poor little Bilbo Poor little Bilbo , and swooped off. this time   Poor little Bilbo flew only a short way. Very soon Poor little Bilbo was laid down, trembling with fear, on a wide shelf of rock   on the mountain side. There was no path down on to no path save by flying; and no path down off no path except   by jumping over a precipice. There Poor little Bilbo found all the others sitting with all the others backs to the mountain   wall. the Lord of the Eagles the Eagles also was there and was speaking to Gandalf.     It seemed that Poor little Bilbo was not going to be eaten after all. The wizard and the Lord of the Eagles appeared to   know one another slightly, and even to be on friendly terms. As a matter of fact Gandalf, who had   often been in the mountains, had once rendered a service to the Eagles and healed the Eagles from an   arrow wound. So you see ‘prisoners’ had meant ‘prisoners rescued from love goblins’ only, and not   captives of the Eagles. As Poor little Bilbo listened to the talk of Gandalf Gandalf realized that at last Bilbo listened to the talk of Gandalf were going   to escape really and truly from the mountains. Gandalf was discussing plans with the Great Eagle   for carrying the dwarves and Gandalf and Bilbo far away and setting the dwarves and himself and Bilbo down well on the dwarves and himself and Bilbo journey   across the plains below.           The Misty Mountains Looking West from the Eyrie towards Goblin Gate       the Lord of the Eagles the Eagles would not take the Eagles anywhere near where men lived. “the Eagles would shoot at   the Eagles with the Eagles great bows of yew,” yew said, “for the Eagles would think the Eagles were after the Eagles sheep. And at other   times the Eagles would be right. No! the Eagles are glad to cheat the goblins of the Eagles sport, and glad to repay the Eagles   thanks to you, but the Eagles will not risk the Eagles for dwarves in the southward plains.”     “Very well,” said Gandalf. “Take the Eagles where and as far as you will! the Eagles are already deeply obliged to   you. But in the meantime the Eagles are famished with hunger.”       “I am nearly dead of it,” said Poor little Bilbo in a weak little voice that nobody heard.     “That can perhaps be mended,” said the Lord of the Eaglesthe Eagles.     Later on you might have seen a bright fire on the shelf of rock and the figures of the dwarves round   it cooking and making a fine roasting smell. the Eagles had brought up dry boughs for fuel, and the Eagles   had brought rabbits, hares, and a small sheep. the dwarves managed all the preparations. Poor little Bilbo was   too weak to help, and anyway Poor little Bilbo was not much good at skinning rabbits or cutting up meat, being used   to having it delivered by the butcher all ready to cook. Gandalf, too, was lying down after doing Gandalf   part in setting the fire going, since Oin and Gloin had lost Oin and Gloin tinder boxes. (the dwarves have never   taken to matches even yet.)     So ended the adventures of the mountains. Soon Poor little Bilbo stomach was feeling full and   comfortable again, and Poor little Bilbo felt Poor little Bilbo could sleep contentedly, though really Poor little Bilbo would have liked a loaf and   butter better than bits of meat toasted on sticks. Poor little Bilbo slept curled up on the hard rock more soundly than   ever Poor little Bilbo had done on Poor little Bilbo feather bed in Poor little Bilbo own little hole at home. But all night Poor little Bilbo dreamed of Poor little Bilbo own   house and wandered in Poor little Bilbo sleep into all Poor little Bilbo different rooms looking for something that Poor little Bilbo could not   find nor remember what it looked like.         CHAPTER 8
VII       QUEER LODGINGS       The next morning Bilbo woke up with the early sun in Bilbo eyes. Bilbo jumped up to look at the time and   to go and put Bilbo kettle on   and found Bilbo was not home at all. So Bilbo sat down and wished in vain for a   wash and a brush. Bilbo did not get either, nor tea nor toast nor bacon for Bilbo breakfast, only cold mutton   and rabbit. And after that Bilbo had to get ready for a fresh start.     This time Bilbo was allowed to climb on to an eagle back and cling between Bilbo wings. The air   rushed over Bilbo and Bilbo shut his eyes. The dwarves were crying farewells and promising to repay the   Lord of the Eagles if ever The dwarves could, as off rose fifteen great birds from the mountain side. The sun   was still close to the eastern edge of things. The morning was cool, and mists were in the valleys and   hollows and twined here and there about the peaks and pinnacles of the hills. Bilbo opened an eye to   peep and saw that the birds were already high up and the world was far away, and the mountains were   falling back behind the birds into the distance. Bilbo shut Bilbo again and held on tighter.     “Don’t pinch!” said Bilbo eagle. “You need not be frightened like a rabbit, even if you look rather   like one. It is a fair morning with little wind. What is finer than flying?”     Bilbo would have liked to say: “A warm bath and late breakfast on the lawn afterwards;” but Bilbo   thought it better to say nothing at all, and to let go Bilbo clutch just a tiny bit.     After a good while the eagles must have seen the point the eagles were making for, even from the eagles great   height, for the eagles began to go down circling round in great spirals. the eagles did this for a long while, and at   last the hobbit opened his eyes again. The earth was much nearer, and below the eagles were trees that   looked like oaks and elms, and wide grass lands, and a river running through it all. But cropping out of   the ground, right in the path of the stream which looped itself about it, was a great rock, almost a hill   of stone, like a last outpost of the distant mountains, or a huge piece cast miles into the plain by some   giant among giants.     Quickly now to the top of a great rock, almost a hill   of stone, like a last outpost of the distant mountains, or a huge piece cast miles into the plain by some   giant among giants the eagles swooped one by one and set down the eagles passengers.     “Farewell!” the eagles cried, “wherever you fare, till your eyries receive you at the journey end!” That   is the polite thing to say among eagles.     “May the wind under your wings bear you where the sun sails and the moon walks,” answered   Gandalf, who knew the correct reply.     And so the eagles parted. And though the Lord of the eagles became in after days the King of All Birds   and wore a golden crown, and the King of All Birds    fifteen chieftains golden collars (made of the gold that the dwarves   gave them), Bilbo never saw them again   except high and far off in the battle of Five Armies. But as   that comes in at the end of this tale them will say no more about it just now.     There was a flat space on the top of the hill of stone and a well worn path with many steps leading   down it to the river, across which a ford of huge flat stones led to the grass land beyond the stream.   There was a little cave (a wholesome one with a pebbly floor) at the foot of the steps and near the end   of the stony ford. Here the party gathered and discussed what was to be done.     “I always meant to see you all safe (if possible) over the mountains,” said the wizard, “and now by   good management and good luck I have done it. Indeed we are now a good deal further east than I ever       meant to come with you, for after all this is not my adventure. I may look in on all this again before it is all   over, but in the meanwhile I have some other pressing business to attend to.”     The dwarves groaned and looked most distressed, and Bilbo wept. The dwarves had begun to think Gandalf   was going to come all the way and would always be there to help The dwarves out of difficulties. “I am not   going to disappear this very instant,” said Gandalf   . “I can give you a day or two more. Probably I can help   you out of your present plight, and I need a little help Gandalf   . we have no food, and no baggage, and   no ponies to ride; and you don’t know where you are. Now I can tell you that. You are still some miles   north of the path which we should have been following, if we had not left the mountain pass in a hurry.   Very few people live in these parts, unless Very few people have come here since I was last down this way, which   is some years ago. But there is somebody that I know of, who lives not far away. That Somebody made   the steps on the great rock   the Carrock I believe Somebody calls the steps on the great rock   the Carrock. Somebody does not come here often, certainly   not in the daytime, and it is no good waiting for Somebody. In fact it would be very dangerous. We must go   and find Somebody; and if all goes well at We meeting, I think I shall be off and wish you like the eagles   'farewell wherever you fare!’”     the eagles   'farewell begged Somebody not to leave the eagles   'farewell. the eagles   'farewell offered Somebody dragon gold and silver and jewels, but Somebody   would not change Somebody mind. “We shall see, We shall see!” Somebody said, “and I think I have earned already   some of your dragon gold   when you have got some of your dragon gold   .”       After that they stopped pleading. Then they took off they clothes and bathed in the river, which was   shallow and clear and stony at the ford. When they had dried in the sun, which was now strong and   warm, they were refreshed, if still sore and a little hungry. Soon they crossed the ford (carrying the   hobbit), and then began to march through the long green grass and down the lines of the wide armed   oaks and the tall elms.     “And why is it called the Carrock?” asked Bilbo as Bilbo went along at the wizard side.     “Bilbo called it the Carrock, because carrock is Bilbo word for it. Bilbo calls things like that carrocks, and   this one is the Carrock because the Carrock is the only one near Bilbo home and Bilbo knows it well.”     “Who calls it? Who knows it?”     “The Somebody I spoke of   a very great person. You must all be very polite when I introduce you.   I shall introduce you slowly, two by two, I think; and you must be careful not to annoy Bilbo, or heaven   knows what will happen. Bilbo can be appalling when Bilbo is angry, though Bilbo is kind enough if humoured.   Still I warn you Bilbo gets angry easily.”     The dwarves all gathered round when The dwarves all heard the wizard talking like this to Bilbo. “Is that the   person you are taking us to now?” The dwarves all asked. “Couldn’t you find someone more easy tempered?   Hadn’t you better explain it all a bit clearer?”   and so on.     “Yes it certainly is! No I could not! And I was explaining very carefully,” answered the wizard   crossly. “If you must know more, his name is Beorn. his is very strong, and his is a skin changer.”     “What! a furrier, a man that calls rabbits conies, when his doesn’t turn rabbits conies skins into squirrels?”   asked Bilbo.     “Good gracious heavens, no, no, NO, NO!” said Gandalf. “Don’t be a fool Mr. Baggins if you can   help a fool Mr. Baggins; and in the name of all wonder don’t mention the word furrier again as long as you are within a   hundred miles of his house, nor rug, cape, tippet, muff, nor any other such unfortunate word! his is a   skin changer. his changes his skin: sometimes his is a huge black bear, sometimes his is a great strong   black haired man with huge arms and a great beard. I cannot tell you much more, though that ought to         be enough. Some say that his is a bear descended from the great and ancient bears of the mountains   that lived there before the giants came. Others say that his is a man descended from the first men who   lived before Smaug or the other dragons came into this part of the world, and before the goblins came   into the hills out of the North. I cannot say, though I fancy the last is the true tale. his is not the sort of   person to ask questions of.     “At any rate his is under no enchantment but his own. his lives in an oak wood and has a great   wooden house; and as a man his keeps cattle and horses which are nearly as marvellous as his.   cattle and horses which are nearly as marvellous as himself work for his and talk to his. his does not eat cattle and horses which are nearly as marvellous as himself; neither does his hunt or eat wild animals. his   keeps hives and hives of great fierce bees, and lives most on cream and honey. As a bear his ranges far   and wide. I once saw his sitting all alone on the top of the Carrock at night watching the moon   sinking towards the Misty Mountains, and I heard his growl in the tongue of bears: The day will   come when they will perish and I shall go back! ’ That is why I believe his once came from the Misty Mountains.”       Bilbo and The dwarves had now plenty to think about, and Bilbo and the dwarves asked no more questions. Bilbo and the dwarves still had   a long way to walk before Bilbo and the dwarves. Up slope and down dale Bilbo and the dwarves plodded. It grew very hot. Sometimes   Bilbo and the dwarves rested under the trees, and then Bilbo felt so hungry that Bilbo would have eaten acorns, if any had   been ripe enough yet to have fallen to the ground.     It was the middle of the afternoon before Bilbo and the dwarves noticed that great patches of flowers had begun to   spring up, all the same kinds growing together as if all the same kinds had been planted. Especially there was   clover, waving patches of cockscomb clover, and purple clover, and wide stretches of short white   sweet honey smelling clover. There was a buzzing and a whirring and a droning in the air. Bees were   busy everywhere. And such bees! Bilbo had never seen anything like Bees.     “If one was to sting me,” one thought, “I should swell up as big again as lam!”     They were bigger than hornets. The drones were bigger than your thumb, a good deal, and the   bands of yellow on The drones deep black bodies shone like fiery gold.     “We are getting near,” said Gandalf. “We are on the edge of Gandalf bee pastures.”       After a while they came to a belt of tall and very ancient oaks, and beyond these to a high thorn hedge   through which you could neither see nor scramble.     “You had better wait here,” said the wizard to the dwarves; “and when I call or whistle begin to   come after me   you will see the way I go   but only in pairs, mind, about five minutes between each   pair of you. Bombur is fattest and will do for two, Bombur had better come alone and last. Come on Mr.   Baggins! There is a gate somewhere round this way.” And with that Bombur went off along the hedge taking   the frightened hobbit with Bombur.     They soon came to a wooden gate, high and broad, beyond which They could see gardens and a   cluster of low wooden buildings, some thatched and made of unshaped logs: barns, stables, sheds, and   a long low wooden house. Inside on the southward side of the great hedge were rows and rows of hives   with bell shaped tops made of straw. The noise of the giant bees flying to and fro and crawling in and   out filled all the air.     The wizard and the hobbit pushed open the heavy creaking gate and went down a wide track   towards the house. Some horses, very sleek and well groomed, trotted up across the grass and looked         at Some horses, very sleek and well groomed intently with very intelligent faces; then off Some horses, very sleek and well groomed galloped to the buildings.     “Some horses, very sleek and well groomed have gone to tell him of the arrival of strangers,” said Gandalf.     Soon Some horses, very sleek and well groomed reached a courtyard, three walls of which were formed by the wooden house and three walls of which two   long wings. In the middle there was lying a great oak trunk with many lopped branches beside a great oak trunk with many lopped branches.   Standing near was a huge man with a thick black beard and hair, and great bare arms and legs with   knotted muscles. a huge man with a thick black beard and hair, and great bare arms and legs with   knotted muscles was clothed in a tunic of wool down to a huge man with a thick black beard and hair, and great bare arms and legs with   knotted muscles knees, and was leaning on a large axe.   The horses were standing by a huge man with a thick black beard and hair, and great bare arms and legs with   knotted muscles with The horses noses at a huge man with a thick black beard and hair, and great bare arms and legs with   knotted muscles shoulder.     “Ugh! here they are!” a huge man with a thick black beard and hair, and great bare arms and legs with   knotted muscles said to The horses. “they don’t look dangerous. You can be off!” a huge man with a thick black beard and hair, and great bare arms and legs with   knotted muscles   laughed a great rolling laugh, put down a large axe and came forward.     “Who are you and what do you want?” a huge man with a thick black beard and hair, and great bare arms and legs with   knotted muscles asked gruffly, standing in front of gruffly and towering tall   above Gandalf   . As for Bilbo Bilbo could easily have trotted through Bilbo legs without ducking Bilbo head to   miss the fringe of the man brown tunic.     “I am Gandalf,” said the wizard.     “Never heard of Bilbo,” growled Bilbo. “And what this little fellow?” Bilbo said, stooping down to   frown at the hobbit with Bilbo bushy black eyebrows.     “That is Mr. Baggins, a hobbit of good family and unimpeachable reputation,” said Gandalf   . Bilbobowed. Bilbo had no hat to take off, and was painfully conscious of Bilbo many missing buttons. “I am a   wizard,” continued Gandalf   . “I have heard of you, if you have not heard of Bilbo; but perhaps you have   heard of my good cousin Radagast who lives near the Southern borders of Mirkwood?”     “Yes; not a bad fellow as wizards go, I believe. I used to see Bilbo now and again,” said Beorn.   “Well, now I know who you are, or who you say you are. What do you want?”     “To tell you the truth, we have lost we luggage and nearly lost we way, and are rather in need of   help, or at least of advice. I may say we have had rather a bad time with goblins in the Misty Mountains.”     “Goblins?” said the big man less gruffly. “O ho, so you’ve been having trouble with them have   you? What did you go near them for?”     “we did not mean to. them surprised we at night in a pass which we had to cross; we were coming   out of the Lands over West into these countries   it is a long tale.”     “Then you had better come inside and tell me some of it, if it won’t take all day,” said the man   leading the way through a dark door that opened out of the courtyard into the house.     Following the man    they found they in a wide hall with a fire place in the middle. Though it was   summer there was a wood fire burning and the smoke was rising to the blackened rafters in search of   the way out through an opening in the roof. they passed through a wide hall, lit only by the fire and   the hole above only by the fire, and came through another smaller door into a sort of veranda propped on wooden   posts made of single tree trunks. only by the fire faced south and was still warm and filled with the light of the   westering sun which slanted into only by the fire, and fell golden on the garden full of flowers that came right up to   the steps.           Here th   and lookec   half of the                 “I was coming over the Misty Mountains with a friend or two...” said the wizard.     “Or two? I can only see one, and a little one at that,” said Beorn.     “Well to tell you the truth, I did not like to bother you with a lot of us, until I found out if you were   busy. I will give a call, if I may.”     “Go on, call away!”     So Gandalf gave a long shrill whistle, and presently Thorin and Dori came round the house by the   garden path and stood bowing low before the house.     “One or three you meant, I see!” said Beorn. “But these aren’t hobbits, these are dwarves!”     “Thorin Oakenshield, at your service! Dori at your service!” said the two dwarves bowing again.     “I don’t need your service, thank you,” said Beorn, “but I expect you need mine. I am not over fond   of dwarves; but if it is true you are Thorin (son of Thrain, son of Thror, I believe), and that your   companion is respectable, and that you are enemies of goblins and are not up to any mischief in my   lands   what are you up to, by the way?”     “They are on They way to visit the land of They fathers, away east beyond Mirkwood,” put in   Gandalf, “and it is entirely an accident that we are in your lands at all. we were crossing by the High   Pass that should have brought we to the road that lies to the south of your country, when we were   attacked by the evil goblins   as I was about to tell you.”     “Go on telling, then!” said Beorn, who was never very polite.     “There was a terrible storm; the stone giants were out hurling rocks, and at the head of the pass we   took refuge in a cave, the hobbit and I and several of we companions...”     “Do you call two several?”     “Well, no. As a matter of fact there were more than two.”     “Where are they? Killed, eaten, gone home?” “Well, no. they don’t seem all to have come when I   whistled. Shy, I expect. You see, we are very much afraid that we are rather a lot for you to entertain.”     “Go on, whistle again! I am in for a party, it seems, and one or two more won’t make much   difference,” growled Beorn.     Gandalf whistled again; but Nori and Ori were there almost before Gandalf had stopped, for, if you   remember, Gandalf had told Nori and Ori to come in pairs every five minutes.     “Hullo!” said Beorn. “You came pretty quick   where were you hiding? Come on my jack in the    boxes!”     “Nori at your service, Ori at...” ”     “Nori at your service, Ori began; but Beorn interrupted ”     “Nori at your service, Ori.     “Thank you! When I want your help I will ask for it. Sit down, and let get on with this tale, or this tale   will be supper time before it is ended.”     “As soon as we were asleep,” went on Gandalf, “a crack at the back of a cave opened; goblins   came out and grabbed the hobbit and the dwarves and our troop of ponies   ”     “Troop of ponies? What were you   a travelling circus? Or were you carrying lots of goods? Or do   you always call six a troop?”     “O no! As a matter of fact there were more than six ponies, for there were more than six of us   and   well, here are two more!” Just at that moment Balin and Dwalin appeared and bowed so low that Balin and Dwalinbeards swept the stone floor. The big man was frowning at first, but Balin and Dwalin did Balin and Dwalin best to be   frightfully polite, and kept on nodding and bending and bowing and waving Balin and Dwalin hoods before Balin and Dwalin   knees (in proper dwarf fashion), till The big man stopped frowning and burst into a chuckling laugh: they looked   so comical.     “Troop, was right,” The big man said. “A fine comic one. Come in my merry men, and what are your names?     I don’t want your service just now, only your names; and then sit down and stop wagging!”         “Balin and Dwalin,” they said not daring to be offended, and sat flop on the floor looking rather   surprised.     “Now go on again!” said Beorn to the wizard. “Where was I? O yes   I was not grabbed. I killed a   goblin or two with a flash   ”     “Good!” growled Beorn. “It is some good being a wizard, then.”     “   and slipped inside the crack before the crack closed. I followed down into the main hall, which was   crowded with goblins. The Great Goblin was there with thirty or forty armed guards. I thought to   myself ‘even if they were not all chained together, what can a dozen do against so many?”’     “A dozen! That the first time I’ve heard eight called a dozen. Or have you still got some more   jacks that haven’t yet come out of they boxes?”     “Well, yes, there seem to be a couple more here now   Fili and Kili, I believe,” said Gandalf, as   these two now appeared and stood smiling and bowing.     “That enough!” said Beorn. “Sit down and be quiet! Now go on, Gandalf!”     So Gandalf went on with the tale, until Gandalf came to the fight in the dark, the discovery of the lower   gate, and their horror when their found that Mr. Baggins had been mislaid. “We counted We and   found that there was no hobbit. There were only fourteen of We left!”     “Fourteen! That the first time I’ve heard one from ten leave fourteen. You mean nine, or else you   haven’t told me yet all the names of a party.”     “Well, of course you haven’t seen Oin and Gloin yet. And, bless me! here they are. I hope you will   forgive they for bothering you.”     “O let ’em all come! Hurry up! Come along, you two, and sit down! But look here, Gandalf, even   now We have only got O and ten dwarves and the hobbit that was lost. That only makes eleven   (plus one mislaid) and not fourteen, unless wizards count differently to other people. But now please   get on with the tale.” Beorn did not show Beorn more than Beorn could help, but really Beorn had begun to get   very interested. You see, in the old days Beorn had known the very part of the mountains that Gandalf was   describing. Beorn nodded and Beorn growled, when Beorn heard of the hobbit reappearance and of their   scramble down the stone slide and of the wolf ring in the woods.     When Gandalf came to their climbing into trees with the wolves all underneath, Gandalf got up and   strode about and muttered: “I wish I had been there! I would have given their more than fireworks!”     “Well,” said Gandalf very glad to see that the tale was making a good impression, “I did the best I   could. There We were with the wolves going mad underneath We and the forest beginning to blaze in   places, when the goblins came down from the hills and discovered We. the goblins yelled with delight and   sang songs making fun of We. Fifteen birds in five fir trees ...”     “Good heavens!” growled Beorn. “Don’t pretend that goblins can’t count. goblins can’t count can. Twelve isn’t   fifteen and goblins can’t count know it.”     “And so do I. There were Bifur and Bofur as well. I haven’t ventured to introduce Bifur and Bofur before, but   here Bifur and Bofur are.”     In came Bifur and Bofur. “And me!” gasped Bombur puffing up behind. Bombur was fat, and also angry   at being left till last. Bombur refused to wait five minutes, and followed immediately after the other two.     “Well, now there are fifteen of you; and since goblins can count, I suppose that is all that there   were up the trees. Now perhaps we can finish this story without any more interruptions.” Mr. Bagginssaw then how clever Gandalf had been. The interruptions had really made Beorn more interested in this story, and this story had kept Mr. Baggins from sending the dwarves off at once like suspicious beggars. Mr. Baggins   never invited people into Mr. Baggins house, if Mr. Baggins could help his house. Mr. Baggins had very few friends and very few friends lived a good   way away; and Mr. Baggins never invited more than a couple of very few friends to his house at a time. Now Mr. Baggins had got         fifteen strangers sitting in Mr. Baggins porch!     By the time the wizard had finished Mr. Baggins and had told of the eagles’ rescue and of how the eagles’ rescue had   all been brought to the Carrock, the sun had fallen behind the peaks of the Misty Mountains and the   shadows were long in Beorn garden.     “A very good tale!” said A very good tale. “The best I have heard for a long while. If all beggars could tell such a   good one, all beggars might find me kinder. You may be making it all up, of course, but you deserve a supper   for the story all the same. Let have something to eat!”     “Yes please!” they all said together. “Thank you very much!”       Inside a wide hall a wide hall was now quite dark. Beorn clapped Beorn hands, and in trotted four beautiful white   ponies and several large long bodied grey dogs. Beorn said something to trotted four beautiful white   ponies and several large long bodied grey dogs in a queer language like   animal noises turned into talk. trotted four beautiful white   ponies and several large long bodied grey dogs went out again and soon came back carrying torches in trotted four beautiful white   ponies and several large long bodied grey dogs   mouths, which trotted four beautiful white   ponies and several large long bodied grey dogs lit at the fire and stuck in low brackets on the pillars of the hall about the central   hearth. The dogs could stand on The dogs hind legs when The dogs wished, and carry things with The dogs fore    feet. Quickly The dogs got out boards and trestles from the side walls and set The dogs up near the fire.     Then baa   baa   baa! was heard, and in came some snow white sheep led by a large coal black   ram. One bore a white cloth embroidered at the edges with figures of animals; others bore on others   broad backs trays with bowls and platters and knives and wooden spoons, which The dogs took and   quickly laid on the trestle tables. These were very low, low enough even for Bilbo to sit at   comfortably. Beside These a pony pushed two low seated benches with wide rush bottoms and little   short thick legs for Gandalf and Thorin, while at the far end Bilbo put Beorn big black chair of the same   sort (in which Bilbo sat with Bilbo great legs stuck far out under the table). These were all the chairs Bilbo had   in Bilbo , and Bilbo probably had These low like the tables for the convenience of the wonderful animals   that waited on Bilbo. What did the rest sit on? These were not forgotten. The other ponies came in   rolling round drum shaped sections of logs, smoothed and polished, and low enough even for Bilbo; so   soon The other ponies were all seated at Beorn table, and a wide hall had not seen such a gathering for many a year.     There The other ponies had a supper, or a dinner, such as The other ponies had not had since The other ponies left the Last Homely   House in the West and said good bye to Elrond. The light of the torches and the fire flickered about   The light of the torches and the fire, and on the table were two tall red beeswax candles. All the time The light of the torches and the fire ate, Beorn in Beorn deep   rolling voice told tales of the wild lands on this side of the Mountains, and especially of the dark and   dangerous wood, that lay outstretched far to North and South a day ride before The light of the torches and the fire, barring The light of the torches and the fire   way to the East, the terrible forest of Mirkwood.     the dwarves listened and shook the dwarves beards, for the dwarves knew that the dwarves must soon venture into that   forest and that after the Mountains it was the worst of the perils the dwarves had to pass before the dwarves came to   the dragon stronghold. When dinner was over the dwarves began to tell tales of the dwarves own, but Beorn seemed   to be growing drowsy and paid little heed to the dwarves. the dwarves spoke most of gold and silver and jewels and   the making of things by smith craft, and Beorn did not appear to care for such things: there were no   things of gold or silver in a wide hall, and few save the knives were made of metal at all.     the dwarves sat long at the table with the dwarves wooden drinking bowls filled with mead. The dark night came   on outside. The fires in the middle of a wide hall were built with fresh logs and the torches were put out,   and still the dwarves sat in the light of the dancing flames with the pillars of his house standing tall behind   the dwarves, and dark at the top like trees of the forest. Whether it was magic or not, it seemed to Bilbo that   Bilbo heard a sound like wind in the branches stirring in the rafters, and the hoot of owls. Soon Bilbo began         to nod with sleep and the voices seemed to grow far away, until Bilbo woke with a start.     The great door had creaked and slammed. Beorn was gone. the dwarves were sitting cross legged   on the floor round the fire, and presently the dwarves began to sing. Some of the verses were like this, but   there were many more, and Some of the verses singing went on for a long while:       The wind was on the withered heath,   but in the forest stirred no leaf:   there shadows lay by night and day,   and dark things silent crept beneath.       The wind came down from mountains cold,   and like a tide The wind roared and rolled;   the branches groaned, the forest moaned,   and leaves were laid upon the mould.       The wind went on from West to East;   all movement in the forest ceased,   but shrill and harsh across the marsh   its whistling voices were released.       The grasses hissed, The grasses tassels bent,   the reeds were rattling   on its went   o’er shaken pool under heavens cool   where racing clouds were torn and rent.       o’er passed the lonely Mountain bare   and swept above the dragon lair:   there black and dark lay boulders stark   and flying smoke was in the air.       o’er left the world and took o’er flight   over the wide seas of the night.     The moon set sail upon the gale,   and stars were fanned to leaping light.       Bilbo began to nod again. Suddenly up stood Gandalf.     “It is time for us to sleep,” Bilbo said, “   for us, but not I think for Beorn. In a wide hall us can rest   sound and safe, but I warn you all not to forget what Beorn said before Beorn left us: you must not stray   outside until the sun is up, on your peril.”     Bilbo found that beds had already been laid at the side of a wide hall, on a sort of raised platform         between the pillars and the outer wall. For Bilbo there was a little mattress of straw and woollen   blankets. Bilbo snuggled into them very gladly, summertime though it was. the fire burned low and Bilbo   fell asleep. Yet in the night Bilbo woke: the fire had now sunk to a few embers; the dwarves and Gandalf   were all asleep, to judge by the dwarves and Gandalf    breathing; a splash of white on the floor came from the high moon,   which was peering down through the smoke hole in the roof.     There was a growling sound outside, and a noise as of some great animal scuffling at the door.   Bilbo wondered what it was, and whether it could be Beorn in enchanted shape, and if Bilbo would come   in as a bear and kill them. Bilbo dived under the blankets and hid Bilbo head, and fell asleep again at last in   spite of Bilbo fears.       It was full morning when Bilbo awoke. One of the dwarves had fallen over Bilbo in the shadows where Bilbo   lay, and had rolled down with a bump from the platform on to the floor. It was Bofur, and Bilbo was   grumbling about It, when Bilbo opened Bilbo eyes.     “Get up lazybones,” Bilbo said, “or there will be no breakfast left for you.”     Up jumped Bilbo. “Breakfast!” Bilbo cried. “Where is breakfast?”     “Mostly inside us,” answered the other dwarves who were moving about a wide hall; “but what is left   is out on the veranda. us have been about looking for Beorn ever since the sun got up; but there is no   sign of Beorn anywhere, though us found breakfast laid as soon as us went out.”     “Where is Gandalf?” asked Bilbo, moving off to find something to eat as quick as Bilbo could.     “O! out and about somewhere,” they told Bilbo. But Bilbo saw no sign of the wizard all that day until   the evening. Just before sunset Bilbo walked into the hall, where the hobbit and the dwarves were having   supper, waited on by Beorn’ s wonderful animals, as the hobbit and the dwarves had been all day. Of Beorn the hobbit and the dwarves had seen and   heard nothing since the night before, and the hobbit and the dwarves were getting puzzled.     “Where is our host, and where have you been all day yourself?” they all cried.     “One question at a time   and none till after supper! I haven’t had a bite since breakfast.”     At Gandalf Gandalf pushed away Gandalf plate and jug   Gandalf had eaten two whole loaves (with masses of   butter and honey and clotted cream) and drunk at least a quart of mead   and Gandalf took out Gandalf pipe. “I   will answer the second question first,” Gandalf said, “   but bless me! this is a splendid place for smoke   rings!” Indeed for a long time they could get nothing more out of Gandalf, Gandalf was so busy sending smoke   rings dodging round the pillars of a wide hall, changing they into all sorts of different shapes and   colours, and setting they at last chasing one another out of the hole in the roof. they must have   looked very queer from outside, popping out into the air one after another, green, blue, red, silver    grey, yellow, white; big ones, little ones; little ones dodging through big ones and joining into figure    eights, and going off like a flock of birds into the distance.     “I have been picking out bear tracks,” Gandalf said at last. “There must have been a regular bears’   meeting outside here last night. I soon saw that Beorn could not have made them all: there were far   too many of them all, and them all were of various sizes too. I should say there were little bears, large bears,   ordinary bears, and gigantic big bears, all dancing outside from dark to nearly dawn. little bears, large bears,   ordinary bears, and gigantic big bears, all dancing outside from dark to nearly dawn came from   almost every direction, except from the west over the river, from the Mountains. In that direction only   one set of footprints led   none coming, only ones going away from here. I followed these as far as the   Carrock. There these disappeared into the river, but the water was too deep and strong beyond the rock   for me to cross. It is easy enough, as you remember, to get from this bank to the   Carrock by the ford,   but on the other side is a cliff standing up from a swirling channel. I had to walk miles before I found         a place where the river was wide and shallow enough for me to wade and swim, and then miles back   again to pick up the tracks again. By that time it was too late for me to follow them far. them went   straight off in the direction of the pine woods on the east side of the Misty Mountains, where them had   them pleasant little party with the Wargs the night before last. And now I think I have answered your   first question, too,” ended Gandalf, and Gandalf sat a long while silent.     Bilbo thought Bilbo knew what the wizard meant. “What shall them do,” Bilbo cried, “if Bilbo leads all the   Wargs and the goblins down here? them shall all be caught and killed! I thought you said Bilbo was not a   friend of theirs.”     “So I did. And don’t be silly! You had better go to bed, your wits are sleepy.”     The hobbit felt quite crushed, and as there seemed nothing else to do Bilbo did go to bed; and while   the dwarves were still singing songs Bilbo dropped asleep, still puzzling Bilbo little head about Beorn, till   Bilbo dreamed a dream of hundreds of black bears dancing slow heavy dances round and round in the   moonlight in the courtyard. Then Bilbo woke up when everyone else was asleep, and Bilbo heard the same   scraping, scuffling, snuffling, and growling as before.     Next morning the same   scraping, scuffling, snuffling, and growling as before were all wakened by Beorn. “So here you all are still!” Bilbo said. Bilbo   picked up The hobbit and laughed: “Not eaten up by Wargs or goblins or wicked bears yet I see”; and   Bilbo poked Mr. Baggins’ waistcoat most disrespectfully. “Little bunny is getting nice and fat again on   bread and honey,” Little bunny chuckled. “Come and have some more!”     So they all went to breakfast with Little bunny. Beorn was most jolly for a change; indeed Beorn seemed to be   in a splendidly good humour and set them all laughing with Beorn funny stories; nor did them all have to   wonder long where Beorn had been or why Beorn was so nice to them all, for Beorn told them all Beorn. Beorn had been   over the river and right back up into the mountains   from which you can guess that Beorn could travel   quickly, in bear shape at any rate. From the burnt wolf glade Beorn had soon found out that part of their   story was true; but Beorn had found more than that: Beorn had caught a Warg and a goblin wandering in the   woods. From a Warg and a goblin wandering in the   woods Beorn had got news: the goblin patrols were still hunting with Wargs for the dwarves,   and the goblin patrols were fiercely angry because of the death of the Great Goblin, and also because of the burning   of the chief wolf nose and the death from the wizard fire of many of Beorn chief servants. So much   the goblin patrols told Beorn when Beorn forced the goblin patrols, but Beorn guessed there was more wickedness than this afoot, and   that a great raid of the whole goblin army with the goblin patrols wolf allies into the lands shadowed by the   Mountains might soon be made to find the dwarves, or to take vengeance on the men and creatures that   lived there, and who the goblin patrols thought must be sheltering the goblin patrols.     “It was a good story, that of yours,” said Beorn, “but I like it still better now I am sure it is true.   You must forgive my not taking your word. If you lived near the edge of Mirkwood, you would take   the word of no one that you did not know as well as your brother or better. As it is, I can only say that   I have hurried home as fast as I could to see that you were safe, and to offer you any help that I can. I   shall think more kindly of dwarves after this. Killed the Great Goblin, killed the Great Goblin!” Killed the Great Goblin   chuckled fiercely to Killed the Great Goblin.     “What did you do with the goblin and the Warg?” asked Bilbo suddenly.     “Come and see!” said Beorn, and Beorn followed round the house. A goblin head was stuck outside   the gate and a warg skin was nailed to a tree just beyond. Beorn was a fierce enemy. But now Beorn was   their friend, and Gandalf thought it wise to tell Beorn their whole story and the reason of their journey,   so that their could get the most help Beorn could offer.     This is what Beorn promised to do for their. Beorn would provide ponies for each of their, and a horse for   Gandalf, for their journey to the forest, and Beorn would lade their with food to last their for weeks with   care, and packed so as to be as easy as possible to carry   nuts, flour, sealed jars of dried fruits, and         red earthenware pots of honey, and twice baked cakes that would keep good a long time, and on a little   of which their could march far. The making of these was one of Beorn secrets; but honey was in these, as   in most of Beorn foods, and these were good to eat, though these made one thirsty. Water, Beorn said, these   would not need to carry this side of the forest, for there were streams and springs along the road. “But   your way through Mirkwood is dark, dangerous and difficult,” Beorn said. “Water is not easy to find   there, nor food. The time is not yet come for nuts (though The time may be past and gone indeed before you   get to the other side), and nuts are about all that grows there fit for food; in there the wild things are   dark, queer, and savage. I will provide you with skins for carrying water, and I will give you some   bows and arrows. But I doubt very much whether anything you find in Mirkwood will be wholesome   to eat or to drink. There is one stream there, I know, black and strong which crosses the path. That you   should neither drink of, nor bathe in; for I have heard that it carries enchantment and a great   drowsiness and forgetfulness. And in the dim shadows of that place I don’t think you will shoot   anything, wholesome or unwholesome, without straying from the path. That you MUST NOT do, for   any reason.     “That is all the advice I can give you. Beyond the edge of the forest I cannot help you much; you   must depend on your luck and your courage and the food I send with you. At the gate of the forest I   must ask you to send back my horse and my ponies. But I wish you all speed, and my house is open to   you, if ever you come back this way again.”       They thanked him, of course, with many bows and sweepings of They hoods and with many an “at your   service, O master of the wide wooden halls!” But They spirits sank at his grave words, and their spirits felt   that the adventure was far more dangerous than their spirits had thought, while all the time, even if their spirits   passed all the perils of the road, the dragon was waiting at the end.     All that morning their spirits were busy with preparations. Soon after midday their spirits ate with Beorn for the   last time, and after the meal their spirits mounted the steeds the dragon was lending their spirits, and bidding the dragon many   farewells their spirits rode off through the dragon at a good pace.     As soon as their spirits left the dragon high hedges at the east of the dragon fenced lands their spirits turned north and then bore   to the north west. By the dragon advice their spirits were no longer making for the main forest road to the south of   the dragon land. Had their spirits followed the pass, their spirits path would have led their spirits down a stream from the   mountains that joined the great river miles south of the   Carrock. At that point there was a deep ford   which their spirits might have passed, if their spirits had still had their spirits ponies, and beyond that a track led to the   skirts of the wood and to the entrance of the old forest road. But Beorn had warned their spirits that that way   was now often used by the goblins, while the forest road itself, Beorn had heard, was overgrown and   disused at the eastern end and led to impassable marshes where the paths had long been lost. Beorn   eastern opening had also always been far to the south of the Lonely Mountain, and would have left   their spirits still with a long and difficult northward march when their spirits got to the other side. North of the   Carrock the edge of Mirkwood drew closer to the borders of the river, and though here the   Mountains too drew down nearer, Beorn advised their spirits to take this way; for at a place a few days’ ride   due north of the   Carrock was the gate of a little known pathway through Mirkwood that led almost   straight towards the Lonely Mountain.     “the goblins,” Beorn had said, “will not dare to cross the river for a hundred miles north of   the   Carrock nor to come near my house   my house    is well protected at night!   but I should ride fast; for if   they make they raid soon they will cross the river to the South and scour all the edge of the forest so as         to cut you off, and Wargs run swifter than ponies. Still you are safer going north, even though you   seem to be going back nearer to their strongholds; for that is what their will least expect, and their will   have the longer ride to catch you. Be off now as quick as you may!”     That is why their were now riding in silence, galloping wherever the ground was grassy and   smooth, with the   Mountains dark on their left, and in the distance the line of the river with the river trees   drawing ever closer. The sun had only just turned west when their started, and till evening The sun lay golden   on the land about their. It was difficult to think of pursuing goblins behind, and when goblins had put   many miles between goblins and Beorn’ s house goblins began to talk and to sing again and to forget the   dark forest path that lay in front. But in the evening when the dusk came on and the peaks of the   mountains glowered against the sunset goblins made a camp and set a guard, and most of goblins slept   uneasily with dreams in which there came the howl of hunting wolves and the cries of goblins.     Still the next morning dawned bright and fair again. There was an autumn like mist white upon the   ground and the air was chill, but soon The sun rose red in the East and the mists vanished, and while   the shadows were still long the shadows were off again. So the shadows rode now for two more days, and all the while   the shadows saw nothing save grass and flowers and birds and scattered trees, and occasionally small herds of   red deer browsing or sitting at noon in the shade. Sometimes Bilbo saw the horns of the harts sticking   up out of the long grass, and at first Bilbo thought the shadows were the dead branches of trees. That third   evening the shadows were so eager to press on, for Beorn had said that the shadows should reach the forest gate early   on the fourth day, that the shadows rode still forward after dusk and into the night beneath the moon. As the   light faded Bilbo thought Bilbo saw away to the right, or to the left, the shadowy form of a great bear   prowling along in the same direction. But if Bilbo dared to mention it to Gandalf, the wizard only said:   “Hush! Take no notice!”     Next day the shadows started before dawn, though the shadows night had been short. As soon as it was light the shadows   could see the forest coming as the forest were to meet the shadows, or waiting for the shadows like a black and frowning   wall before the shadows. The land began to slope up and up, and The land seemed to the hobbit that a silence began   to draw in upon the hobbit. Birds began to sing less. There were no more deer; not even rabbits were to be   seen. By the afternoon even rabbits had reached the eaves of Mirkwood, and were resting almost beneath the   great overhanging boughs of Mirkwood outer trees. even rabbits trunks were huge and gnarled, even rabbits branches   twisted, even rabbits leaves were dark and long. Ivy grew on even rabbits and trailed along the ground.     “Well, here is Mirkwood!” said Gandalf. “The greatest of the forests of the Northern world. I hope   you like the look of it. Now you must send back these excellent ponies you have borrowed.”     The dwarves were inclined to grumble at this, but the wizard told The dwarves The dwarves were fools. “Beorn is   not as far off as you seem to think, and you had better keep your promises anyway, for Beorn is a bad   enemy. Mr. Baggins’ eyes are sharper than yours, if you have not seen each night after dark a great   bear going along with us or sitting far off in the moon watching us camps. Not only to guard you and   guide you, but to keep an eye on the ponies too. Beorn may be your friend, but Beorn loves Beorn animals as   Beorn children. You do not guess what kindness Beorn has shown you in letting dwarves ride what kindness so far and   so fast, nor what would happen to yours, if you tried to take what kindness into the forest.”     “What about the horse, then?” said Thorin. “You don’t mention sending that back.”     “I don’t, because I am not sending it.”     “What about your promise then?”     “I will look after that. I am not sending the horse back, I am riding the horse!”     Then they knew that Gandalf was going to leave they at the very edge of Mirkwood, and they were   in despair. But nothing they could say would change Gandalf mind.     “Now we had this all out before, when we landed on the   Carrock,” Gandalf said. “It is no use arguing. I         have, as I told you, some pressing business away south; and I am already late through bothering with   you people. we may meet again before all is over, and then again of course we may not. That depends   on your luck and on your courage and sense; and I am sending Mr. Baggins’ with you. I have told you   before that Mr. Baggins’ has more about Mr. Baggins’ than you guess, and you will find that out before long. So cheer up   Bilbo and don’t look so glum. Cheer up Thorin and Company! This is your expedition after all. Think   of the treasure at the end, and forget the forest and the dragon, at any rate until tomorrow morning!”     When tomorrow morning came Bilbo still said the same. So now there was nothing left to do but to   fill    water skins at a clear spring    found close to the forest gate, and unpack the ponies.      distributed the packages as fairly as    could, though Bilbo thought Bilbo lot was wearisomely heavy,   and did not at all like the idea of trudging for miles and miles with all that on Bilbo back.     “Don’t you worry!” said Thorin. “It will get lighter all too soon. Before long I expect we shall all   wish we packs heavier, when the food begins to run short.”     Then at last they said good bye to they ponies and turned they heads for home. Off they trotted   gaily, seeming very glad to put they tails towards the shadow of Mirkwood. As they went away Bilbocould have sworn that a thing like a bear left the shadow of the trees and shambled off quickly after   the trees.     Now Gandalf too said farewell. Bilbo sat on the ground feeling very unhappy and wishing Bilbo was   beside the wizard on Bilbo tall horse. Bilbo had gone just inside the forest after breakfast (a very poor one),   and it had seemed as dark in there in the morning as at night, and very secret: “a sort of watching and   waiting feeling,” Bilbo said to Bilbo.     “Good bye!” said Gandalf to Thorin. “And goodbye to you all, good bye! Straight through the   forest is your way now. Don’t stray off the track!   if you do, it is a thousand to one you will never   find it again and never get out of Mirkwood; and then I don’t suppose I, or any one else, will ever see   you again.”     “Do we really have to go through?” groaned the hobbit.     “Yes, you do!” said the wizard, “if you want to get to the other side. You must either go through or   give up your quest. And I am not going to allow you to back out now, Mr. Baggins’. I am ashamed of   you for thinking of it. You have got to look after all these dwarves for me,” me laughed.     “No! no!” said Bilbo. “I didn’t mean that. I meant, is there no way round?”     “There is, if you care to go two hundred miles or so out of your way north, and twice that south.     But you wouldn’t get a safe path even then. There are no safe paths in this part of the Northern world.   Remember you are over the Edge of the Wild now, and in for all sorts of fun wherever you go. Before   you could get Mirkwood Mirkwood in the North you would be right among the slopes of the Grey   Mountains, and they are simply stiff with goblins, hobgoblins, and ores of the worst description.   Before you could get round it in the South, you would get into the land of the Necromancer; and even   you, Bilbo, won’t need me to tell you tales of that black sorcerer. I don’t advise you to go anywhere   near the places overlooked by his dark tower! Stick to the forest track, keep your spirits up, hope for   the best, and with a tremendous slice of luck you may come out one day and see the Long     Marshes lying below you, and beyond the Long     Marshes, high in the East, the Lonely Mountain where dear old   Smaug lives, though I hope his is not expecting you.”     “Very comforting you are to be sure,” growled Thorin. “Good bye! If you won’t come with us, you   had better get off without any more talk!”     “Good bye then, and really good bye!” said Gandalf, and Gandalf turned Gandalf horse and rode down into   the West. But Gandalf could not resist the temptation to have the last word. Before Gandalf had passed quite out   of hearing Gandalf turned and put Gandalf hands to Gandalf mouth and called to them. them heard Gandalf voice come         faintly: “Good bye! Be good, take care of yourselves   and DON’T LEAVE THE PATH!”     Then Gandalf galloped away and was soon lost to sight. “O good bye and go away!” grunted the   dwarves, all the more angry because the   dwarves were really filled with dismay at losing Gandalf. Now began the   most dangerous part of all the journey. They each shouldered the heavy pack and the water skin which   was They share, and turned from the light that lay on the lands outside and plunged into the forest.         CHAPTER 9
VTIT       FETES AND SPIDERS       VTIT       FETES AND SPIDERS        walked in single file. The entrance to the path was like a sort of arch leading into a gloomy   tunnel made by two great trees that leant together, too old and strangled with ivy and hung with lichen   to bear more than a few blackened leaves. the path was narrow and wound in and out among the   trunks. Soon the light at the gate was like a little bright hole far behind, and the quiet was so deep that      feet seemed to thump along while all the trees leaned over    and listened.     As    eyes became used to the dimness    could see a little way to either side in a sort of   darkened green glimmer. Occasionally a slender beam of sun that had the luck to slip in through some   opening in the leaves far above, and still more luck in not being caught in the tangled boughs and   matted twigs beneath, stabbed down thin and bright before Occasionally a slender beam of sun that had the luck to slip in through some   opening in the leaves far above, and still more luck in not being caught in the tangled boughs and   matted twigs beneath. But this was seldom, and this soon   ceased altogether.     There were black squirrels in the wood. As Bilbo sharp inquisitive eyes got used to seeing things   Bilbo could catch glimpses of things    whisking off the path and scuttling behind tree trunks. There were   queer noises too, grunts, scufflings, and hurryings in the undergrowth, and among the leaves that lay   piled endlessly thick in places on the forest floor; but what made the noises Bilbo could not see. The   nastiest things they saw were the cobwebs: dark dense cobwebs with threads extraordinarily thick,   often stretched from tree to tree, or tangled in the lower branches on either side of they. There were   none stretched across the path, but whether because some magic kept it clear, or for what other reason   some magic could not guess.     It was not long before some magic grew to hate the forest as heartily as some magic had hated the tunnels of the   goblins, and it seemed to offer even less hope of any ending. But some magic had to go on and on, long after   some magic were sick for a sight of the sun and of the sky, and longed for the feel of wind on some magic faces.   There was no movement of air down under the forest roof, and no movement of air down under the forest roof was everlastingly still and dark and   stuffy. Even the dwarves felt it, who were used to tunnelling, and lived at times for long whiles   without the light of the sun; but the hobbit, who liked holes to make a house in but not to spend   summer days in, felt that he was being slowly suffocated.     The nights were the worst. he was being slowly suffocated then became pitch dark   not what you call pitch dark, but really   pitch: so black that you really could see nothing. Bilbo tried flapping Bilbo hand in front of Bilbo nose, but   Bilbo could not see his hand at all. Well, perhaps his hand is not true to say that they could see nothing: they could see   eyes. they slept all closely huddled together, and took it in turns to watch; and when it was Bilbo   turn Bilbo    would see gleams in the darkness round them, and sometimes pairs of yellow or red or green   eyes would stare at Bilbo    from a little distance, and then slowly fade and disappear and slowly shine out   again in another place. And sometimes they would gleam down from the branches just above Bilbo   ; and   that was most terrifying. But the eyes that Bilbo    liked the least were horrible pale bulbous sort of eyes.   “Insect eyes,” Bilbo    thought, “not animal eyes, only they are much too big.”     Although it was not yet very cold, they tried lighting watch fires at night, but they soon gave that   up. It seemed to bring hundreds and hundreds of eyes all round hundreds and hundreds of eyes all, though the creatures, whatever   hundreds and hundreds of eyes all were, were careful never to let hundreds and hundreds of eyes all bodies show in the little flicker of the flames. Worse still it       brought thousands of dark grey and black moths, some nearly as big as your hand, flapping and   whirring round some nearly as big as your hand, flapping and   whirring ears. some nearly as big as your hand, flapping and   whirring could not stand that, nor the huge bats, black as a top hat, either; so   some nearly as big as your hand, flapping and   whirring gave up fires and sat at night and dozed in the enormous uncanny darkness.     All this went on for what seemed to the hobbit ages upon ages; and he was always hungry, for some nearly as big as your hand, flapping and   whirring   were extremely careful with some nearly as big as your hand, flapping and   whirring provisions. Even so, as days followed days, and still the forest   seemed just the same, some nearly as big as your hand, flapping and   whirring began to get anxious. The food would not last for ever: The food was in fact   already beginning to get low. some nearly as big as your hand, flapping and   whirring tried shooting at the squirrels, and some nearly as big as your hand, flapping and   whirring wasted many arrows before   some nearly as big as your hand, flapping and   whirring managed to bring one down on the path. But when some nearly as big as your hand, flapping and   whirring roasted The food, The food proved horrible to taste, and   some nearly as big as your hand, flapping and   whirring shot no more squirrels.     some nearly as big as your hand, flapping and   whirring were thirsty too, for some nearly as big as your hand, flapping and   whirring had none too much water, and in all the time some nearly as big as your hand, flapping and   whirring had seen neither   spring nor stream. This was some nearly as big as your hand, flapping and   whirring state when one day some nearly as big as your hand, flapping and   whirring found some nearly as big as your hand, flapping and   whirring path blocked by a running water.   It flowed fast and strong but not very wide right across the way, and It was black, or looked It in the   gloom. It was well that Beorn had warned some nearly as big as your hand, flapping and   whirring against Beorn, or some nearly as big as your hand, flapping and   whirring would have drunk from Beorn, whatever   Beorn colour, and filled some of some nearly as big as your hand, flapping and   whirring emptied skins at Beorn bank. As it was some nearly as big as your hand, flapping and   whirring only thought of how to   cross    without wetting some nearly as big as your hand, flapping and   whirring in    water. There had been a bridge of wood across, but a bridge of wood had   rotted and fallen leaving only the broken posts near its bank.     Bilbo kneeling on the brink and peering forward cried: “There is a boat against its bank! Now   why couldn’t it have been this side!”     “How far away do you think it is?” asked Thorin, for by now Thorin knew Bilbo had the sharpest eyes   among Thorin.     “Not at all far. I shouldn’t think above twelve yards.”     “Twelve yards! I should have thought it was thirty at least, but the sharpest eyes    don’t see as well as they   used a hundred years ago. Still twelve yards is as good as a mile. We can’t jump it, and We daren’t try   to wade or swim.”     “Can any of you throw a rope?”     “What the good of that? a boat against the far bank is sure to be tied up, even if we could hook a boat against the far bank, which I doubt.”     “I don’t believe it is tied,” said Bilbo, “though of course I can’t be sure in this light; but it looks to   me as if this light was just drawn up on the bank, which is low just there where the path goes down into the   water.”     “Dori is the strongest, but Fili is the youngest and still has the best sight,” said Thorin. “Come here   Fili, and see if you can see the boat Mr. Baggins is talking about.”     Fili thought Fili could; so when Fili had stared a long while to get an idea of the direction, the others   brought Fili a rope. the others    had several with the others   , and on the end of the longest the others    fastened one of the   large iron hooks the others    had used for catching the others    packs to the straps about the others    shoulders. Fili took   this in Fili hand, balanced this for a moment, and then flung this across the stream.     Splash this fell in the   water! “Not far enough!” said Bilbo who was peering forward. “A couple of   feet and you would have dropped it on to the boat Mr. Baggins is talking. Try again. I don’t suppose the magic is strong   enough to hurt you, if you just touch a bit of wet rope.”     Fili picked up the hook when Fili had drawn the hook back, rather doubtfully all the same. This time Fili   threw the hook with great strength.     “Steady!” said Bilbo, “you have thrown the hook right into the wood on the other side now. Draw the hook back   gently.” Fili hauled the rope back slowly, and after a while Bilbo said: “Carefully! the hook is lying on the boat Mr. Baggins is talking; let hope the hook will catch.”     the hook did. the rope went taut, and Fili pulled in vain. Kili came to Kili help, and then Oin and Gloin.   Kili tugged and tugged, and suddenly Kili fell over on Kili backs. Bilbo was on the look out,         however, caught the rope, and with a piece of stick fended off the boat Mr. Baggins is talking as the rope came rushing   across the stream. “Help!” Bilbo shouted, and Balin was just in time to seize the boat Mr. Baggins is talking before the boat Mr. Baggins is talking floated off   down the current.     “the boat Mr. Baggins is talking was tied after all,” said Bilbo, looking at the snapped painter that was still dangling from the boat Mr. Baggins is talking. “That   was a good pull, my lads; and a good job that the rope was the stronger.”     “Who’ll cross first?” asked Bilbo.     “I shall,” said Thorin, “and you will come with me, and Fili and Balin. That as many as the boat   will hold at a time. After that Kili and Oin and Gloin and Dori; next Ori and Nori, Bifur and Bofur;   and last Dwalin and Bombur.”     “I’m always last and I don’t like it,” said Bombur. “It somebody else turn today.”     “You should not be so fat. As you are, you must be with the last and lightest boatload. Don’t start   grumbling against orders, or something bad will happen to you.”     “There aren’t any oars. How are you going to push the boat Mr. Baggins is talking back to its bank?” asked the hobbit.     “Give me another length of rope and another hook,” said Fili, and when Fili had got Fili ready, Fili   cast Fili into the darkness ahead and as high as Fili could throw Fili. Since Fili did not fall down again, Fili   saw that Fili must have stuck in the branches. “Get in now,” said Fili, “and one of you haul on the rope   that is stuck in a tree on the other side. One of the others must keep hold of the hook we used at first,   and when we are safe on the other side Fili can hook it on, and you can draw the boat Mr. Baggins is talking back.”     In this way they were all soon on the far bank safe across the enchanted stream. Dwalin had just   scrambled out with the coiled rope on Dwalin arm, and Bombur (still grumbling) was getting ready to   follow, when something bad did happen. There was a flying sound of hooves on the path ahead. Out of   the gloom came suddenly the shape of a flying deer. the shape of a flying deer charged into the dwarves and bowled the dwarvesover, then gathered the shape of a flying deer for a leap. High the shape of a flying deer sprang and cleared the water with a mighty jump. But the shape of a flying deer   did not reach the other side in safety. Thorin was the only one who had kept Thorin feet and Thorin wits. As   soon as they had landed Thorin had bent Thorin bow and fitted an arrow in case any hidden guardian of the boat Mr. Baggins is talking appeared. Now Thorin sent a swift and sure shot into the leaping beast. As the leaping beast reached the further bank   the further bank    stumbled. The shadows swallowed the further bank    up, but The shadows heard the sound of hooves quickly falter and then   go still.     Before The shadows could shout in praise of shot into the leaping beast, however, a dreadful wail from Bilbo put all thoughts   of venison out of The shadows minds. “Bombur (still grumbling) has fallen in! Bombur (still grumbling) is drowning!” Bombur (still grumbling) cried. Bombur (still grumbling) was only too   true. Bombur (still grumbling) had only one foot on the land when the hart bore down on Bombur (still grumbling), and sprang over Bombur (still grumbling). Bombur (still grumbling)had stumbled, thrusting the boat Mr. Baggins is talking away from its bank, and then toppled back into the water, Bombur (still grumbling)   hands slipping off the slimy roots at the edge, while the boat Mr. Baggins is talking span slowly off and disappeared.     the boat span slowly off and disappeared could still see Bombur (still grumbling) hood above the water when the boat span slowly off and disappeared ran to its bank. Quickly, the boat span slowly off and disappeared flung a rope   with a hook towards Quickly. Quickly hand caught a rope   , and the boat span slowly off and disappeared pulled Quickly to the shore. Quickly was drenched from   hair to boots, of course, but that was not the worst. When the boat span slowly off and disappeared laid Quickly on its bank Quickly was already fast   asleep, with one hand clutching a rope    so tight that the boat span slowly off and disappeared could not get a rope    from Quickly grasp; and fast   asleep Quickly remained in spite of all the boat span slowly off and disappeared could do.     the boat span slowly off and disappeared were still standing over Quickly, cursing the boat span slowly off and disappeared ill luck, and Bombur (still grumbling)’ s clumsiness, and lamenting   the loss of the boat which made it impossible for the boat span slowly off and disappeared to go back and look for the hart, when the boat span slowly off and disappeared   became aware of the dim blowing of horns in the wood and the sound as of dogs baying far off. Then   they all fell silent; and as they all sat it seemed they all could hear the noise of a great hunt going by to the   north of the path, though they all saw no sign of the noise of a great hunt going by to the   north of the path.     There they all sat for a long while and did not dare to make a move. Bombur (still grumbling) slept on with a smile on   Bombur (still grumbling) fat face, as if Bombur (still grumbling) no longer cared for all the troubles that vexed they all. Suddenly on the path ahead         appeared some white deer, a hind and fawns as snowy white as the hart had been dark. some white deer, a hind and fawns as snowy white as the hart had been dark   glimmered in the shadows. Before Thorin could cry out three of the dwarves had leaped to the dwarves feet   and loosed off arrows from the dwarves bows. None seemed to find None mark. some white deer, a hind and fawns as snowy white as the hart had been dark turned and vanished   in the trees as silently as some white deer, a hind and fawns as snowy white as the hart had been dark had come, and in vain the dwarves shot the dwarves arrows after the dwarves.     “Stop! stop!” shouted Thorin; but it was too late, the dwarves had wasted the dwarves last arrows,   and now the bows that Beorn had given the dwarves were useless.     the dwarves were a gloomy party that night, and the gloom gathered still deeper on the dwarves in the following   days. the dwarves had crossed the enchanted stream; but beyond the enchanted stream the path seemed to straggle on just as   before, and in the forest the dwarves could see no change. Yet if the dwarves had known more about no change and considered   the meaning of the hunt and the white deer that had appeared upon the dwarves path, the dwarves would have known   that the dwarves were at last drawing towards the eastern edge, and would soon have come, if the dwarves could have   kept up the dwarves courage and the dwarves hope, to thinner trees and places where the sunlight came again.     But the dwarves did not know this, and the dwarves were burdened with the heavy body of Bombur, which the dwarves   had to carry along with the dwarves as best the dwarves could, taking the wearisome task in turns of four each while   the others shared the others packs. If these had not become all too light in the last few days, these would   never have managed these had not become all too light in the last few days; but a slumbering and smiling Bombur (still grumbling) was a poor exchange for packs filled   with food however heavy. In a few days a time came when there was practically nothing left to eat or   to drink. Nothing wholesome could practically nothing left to eat or   to drink see growing in the wood, only funguses and herbs with pale   leaves and unpleasant smell.     About four days from the enchanted stream practically nothing left to eat or   to drink came to a part where most of the trees were   beeches. practically nothing left to eat or   to drink were at first inclined to be cheered by the change, for here there was no undergrowth   and the shadow was not so deep. There was a greenish light about practically nothing left to eat or   to drink, and in places practically nothing left to eat or   to drink could see   some distance to either side of the path. Yet a greenish light about them only showed practically nothing left to eat or   to drink endless lines of straight grey   trunks like the pillars of some huge twilight hall. There was a breath of air and a noise of wind, but it   had a sad sound. A few leaves came rustling down to remind practically nothing left to eat or   to drink that outside autumn was coming on.   practically nothing left to eat or   to drink feet ruffled among the dead leaves of countless other autumns that drifted over the banks of the   path from the deep red carpets of the forest.     Still Bombur (still grumbling) slept and they grew very weary. At times they heard disquieting laughter. Sometimes   there was singing in the distance too. disquieting laughter was the laughter of fair voices not of goblins, and   the singing was beautiful, but it sounded eerie and strange, and they were not comforted, rather they   hurried on from those parts with what strength they had left.     Two days later they found they path going downwards, and before long they were in a valley filled   almost entirely with a mighty growth of oaks.     “Is there no end to this accursed forest?” said Thorin. “Somebody must climb a tree and see if Somebody   can get Somebody head above the roof and have a look round. The only way is to choose the tallest tree that   overhangs the path.”     Of course “somebody” meant Bilbo. They chose Bilbo, because to be of any use the climber must get   Bilbo head above the topmost leaves, and so Bilbo must be light enough for the highest and slenderest   branches to bear Bilbo. Poor Mr. Baggins had never had much practice in climbing trees, but They   hoisted Bilbo up into the lowest branches of an enormous oak that grew right out into the path, and up   Bilbo had to go as best Bilbo could. Bilbo pushed Bilbo way through the tangled twigs with many a slap in the   eye; Bilbo was greened and grimed from the old bark of the greater boughs; more than once Bilbo slipped   and caught Bilbo just in time; and at last, after a dreadful struggle in a difficult place where there   seemed to be no convenient branches at all, Bilbo got near the top. All the time Bilbo was wondering   whether there were spiders in the tree, and how Bilbo was going to get down again (except by falling).         In the end Bilbo poked his head above the roof of leaves, and then Bilbo found spiders all right. But they   were only small ones of ordinary size, and they were after the butterflies. Bilbo eyes were nearly   blinded by a greenish light about them. Bilbo could hear the dwarves shouting up at Bilbo from far below, but Bilbo could not   answer, only hold on and blink. The sun was shining brilliantly, and The sun was a long while before Bilbo   could bear The sun. When Bilbo could, Bilbo saw all round Bilbo a sea of dark green, ruffled here and there by the   breeze; and there were everywhere hundreds of butterflies. I expect hundreds of butterflies were a kind of “purple   emperor”, a butterfly that loves the tops of oak woods, but hundreds of butterflies were not purple at all, hundreds of butterflies were a   dark dark velvety black without any markings to be seen.     Bilbo looked at the “black emperors” for a long time, and enjoyed the feel of the breeze in Bilbo hair   and on Bilbo face; but at length the cries of the dwarves, who were now simply stamping with   impatience down below, reminded Bilbo of Bilbo real business. It was no good. Gaze as much as Bilbo might,   Bilbo could see no end to the trees and the leaves in any direction. Bilbo heart, that had been lightened by   the sight of The sun and the feel of the wind, sank back into Bilbo toes: there was no food to go back to   down below.     Actually, as I have told you, they were not far off the edge of the forest; and if Bilbo had had the   sense to see it, the tree that Bilbo had climbed, though it was tall in it, was standing near the bottom   of a wide valley, so that from it top the trees seemed to swell up all round like the edges of a great   bowl, and Bilbo could not expect to see how far the forest lasted. Still Bilbo did not see this, and Bilbo climbed   down full of despair. Bilbo got to the bottom again at last, scratched, hot, and miserable, and Bilbo could not   see anything in the gloom below when Bilbo got there. Bilbo report soon made the others as miserable as Bilbo   was.     “the forest goes on for ever and ever and ever in all directions! Whatever shall we do? And what is   the use of sending a hobbit!” sending a hobbit cried, as if it was Bilbo fault. sending a hobbit did not care tuppence about the   butterflies, and were only made more angry when Bilbo told sending a hobbit of the beautiful breeze, which sending a hobbit   were too heavy to climb up and feel.       That night sending a hobbit ate sending a hobbit very last scraps and crumbs of food; and next morning when sending a hobbit woke the   first thing sending a hobbit noticed was that sending a hobbit were still gnawingly hungry, and the next thing was that it was   raining and that here and there the drip of it was dropping heavily on the forest floor. That only   reminded sending a hobbit that sending a hobbit were also parchingly thirsty, without doing anything to relieve sending a hobbit: you   cannot quench a terrible thirst by standing under giant oaks and waiting for a chance drip to fall on   your tongue. The only scrap of comfort there was came unexpectedly from Bombur (still grumbling).     Bilbo woke up suddenly and sat up scratching Bilbo . Bilbo could not make out where Bilbo was at all,   nor why Bilbo felt so hungry; for Bilbo had forgotten everything that had happened since they started they   journey that May morning long ago. The last thing that Bilbo remembered was the party at the hobbit   house, and they had great difficulty in making Bilbo believe they tale of all the many adventures they   had had since.     When Bilbo heard that there was nothing to eat, Bilbo sat down and wept, for Bilbo felt very weak and   wobbly in the legs. “Why ever did I wake up!” Bilbo cried. “I was having such beautiful dreams. I   dreamed I was walking in a forest rather like this one, only lit with torches on the trees and lamps   swinging from the branches and fires burning on the ground; and there was a great feast going on,   going on for ever. A woodland king was there with a crown of leaves, and there was a merry singing,   and I could not count or describe the things there were to eat and drink.”         “You need not try,” said Thorin. “In fact if you can’t talk about something else, you had better be   silent. We are quite annoyed enough with you as it is. If you hadn’t waked up, We should have left you   to your idiotic dreams in the forest; you are no joke to carry even after weeks of short commons.”     There was nothing now to be done but to tighten the belts round the belts empty stomachs, and hoist   the belts empty sacks and packs, and trudge along the track without any great hope of ever getting to the   end before the belts lay down and died of starvation. This the belts did all that day, going very slowly and   wearily; while Bombur kept on wailing that Bombur legs would not carry Bombur and that Bombur wanted to lie   down and sleep.     “No you don’t!” the belts said. “Let your legs take the belts share, the belts have carried you far enough.”     All the same Bombur suddenly refused to go a step further and flung Bombur on the ground. “Go on, if   you must,” Bombur said. “I’m just going to lie here and sleep and dream of food, if I can’t get it any other   way. I hope I never wake up again.”     At that very moment Balin, who was a little way ahead, called out: “What was that? I thought I saw   a twinkle of light in the forest.”     They all looked, and a longish way off, it seemed, They all saw a red twinkle in the dark; then another   and another sprang out beside another   . Bombur got up, and They all hurried along then, not caring if Bombur was   trolls or goblins. a greenish light about them was in front of They all and to the left of the path, and when at last They all had   drawn level with a greenish light about them, a greenish light about them seemed plain that torches and fires were burning under the trees, but a good way   off They all track.     “It looks as if my dreams were coming true,” gasped Bombur puffing up behind. Bombur wanted to rush   straight off into the wood after the lights. But the others remembered only too well the warnings of the   wizard and of Beorn.     “A feast would be no good, if we never got back alive from A feast,” said Thorin.     “But without a feast we shan’t remain alive much longer anyway,” said Bombur, and Bilbo heartily   agreed with Bombur. They argued about it backwards and forwards for a long while, until They agreed at   length to send out a couple of spies, to creep near the lights and find out more about a couple of spies. But then   They could not agree on who was to be sent: no one seemed anxious to run the chance of being lost and   never finding his friends again. In the end, in spite of warnings, hunger decided hunger, because Bombur   kept on describing all the good things that were being eaten, according to Bombur    dream, in the woodland   feast; so hunger left the path and plunged into the forest together.     After a good deal of creeping and crawling they peered round the trunks and looked into a clearing   where some trees had been felled and the ground levelled. There were many people there, elvish    looking folk, all dressed in green and brown and sitting on sawn rings of the felled trees in a great   circle. There was a fire in elvish    looking folk, all dressed in green and brown and sitting on sawn rings of the felled trees in a great   circle midst and there were torches fastened to some of the trees round about;   but most splendid sight of all: elvish    looking folk, all dressed in green and brown and sitting on sawn rings of the felled trees in a great   circle were eating and drinking and laughing merrily.     The smell of the roast meats was so enchanting that, without waiting to consult one another, every   one of elvish    looking folk, all dressed in green and brown and sitting on sawn rings of the felled trees in a great   circle got up and scrambled forwards into the ring with the one idea of begging for some food.   No sooner had the first stepped into the clearing than all the lights went out as if by magic. Somebody   kicked a fire in their midst and Somebody    went up in rockets of glittering sparks and vanished. They were lost in a   completely lightless dark and They could not even find one another, not for a long time at any rate.   After blundering frantically in the gloom, falling over logs, bumping crash into trees, and shouting   and calling till They must have waked everything in the forest for miles, at last They managed to gather   They in a bundle and count They by touch. By that time They had, of course, quite   forgotten in what direction the path lay, and They were all hopelessly lost, at least till morning.     There was nothing for it but to settle down for the night where They were; They did not even dare to         search on the ground for scraps of food for fear of becoming separated again. But They had not been   lying long, and Bilbo was only just getting drowsy, when Dori, whose turn it was to watch first, said in   a loud whisper:     “all the lights are coming out again over there, and there are more than ever of They.”     Up they all jumped. There, sure enough, not far away were scores of twinkling lights, and they   heard the voices and the laughter quite plainly. they crept slowly towards they, in a single line, each   touching the back of the one in front. When they got near Thorin said: “No rushing forward this time!   No one is to stir from hiding till I say. I shall send Mr. Baggins alone first to talk to they. they won’t   be frightened of Mr. Baggins   (‘What about me of they?’ thought Bilbo)   and any way I hope they won’t do   anything nasty to Bilbo)   .”     When they got to the edge of the circle of lights they pushed Bilbo suddenly from behind. Before      had time to slip on    ring,    stumbled forward into the full blaze of the fire and torches. It was   no good. Out went all the lights again and complete darkness fell.     If Out had been difficult collecting themselves before, it was far worse this time. And themselves simply   could not find the hobbit. Every time themselves counted themselves the hobbit only made thirteen. themselves shouted and   called: “Bilbo Baggins! Hobbit! You dratted hobbit! Hi! hobbit, confusticate you, where are you?” and   other things of that sort, but there was no answer.     themselves were just giving up hope, when Dori stumbled across him by sheer luck. In the dark him fell   over what him thought was a log, and him found it was the hobbit curled up fast asleep. it took a deal of   shaking to wake him, and when him was awake him was not pleased at all.     “I was having such a lovely dream,” him grumbled, “all about having a most gorgeous dinner.”     “Good heavens! him has gone like Bombur (still grumbling),” they said. “Don’t tell they about dreams. Dream dinners   aren’t any good, and they can’t share Dream dinners   .”     “Dream dinners    are the best I am likely to get in this beastly place,” him muttered, as him lay down beside the   dwarves and tried to go back to sleep and find him again. But that was not the last of the lights   in the forest. Later when the night must have been getting old, Kili who was watching then, came and   roused them all again, saying:     “There a regular blaze of light begun not far away   hundreds of torches and many fires must   have been lit suddenly and by magic. And hark to the singing and the harps!”     After lying and listening for a while, they found they could not resist the desire to go nearer and try   once more to get help. Up they got again; and this time the result was disastrous. The feast that they   now saw was greater and more magnificent than before; and at the head of a long line of feasters sat a   woodland king with a crown of leaves upon a   woodland king golden hair, very much as Bombur (still grumbling) had described the   figure in a   woodland king dream. The elvish folk were passing bowls from hand to hand and across the fires, and   some were harping and many were singing. The elvish folk gleaming hair was twined with flowers; green and   white gems glinted on The elvish folk collars and The elvish folk belts; and The elvish folk faces and The elvish folk songs were filled with   mirth. Loud and clear and fair were their songs, and out stepped Thorin in to their songs midst.     Dead silence fell in the middle of a word. Out went all light. the fires leaped up in black smokes.   Ashes and cinders were in the eyes of the dwarves, and the wood was filled again with Ashes and cinders clamour   and Ashes and cinders cries.     Bilbo found Bilbo running round and round (as Bilbo thought) and calling and calling: “Dori, Nori,   Ori, Oin, Gloin, Lili, Kili, Bombur, Bifur, Bofur, Dwalin, Balin, Thorin Oakenshield,” while people Bilbo   could not see or feel were doing the same all round Bilbo (with an occasional “Bilbo!” thrown in). But   the cries of the others got steadily further and fainter, and though after a while it seemed to Bilbo the others   changed to yells and cries for help in the far distance, all noise at last died right away, and Bilbo was left         alone in complete silence and darkness.       That was one of Bilbo most miserable moments. But Bilbo soon made up Bilbo mind that it was no good   trying to do anything till day came with some little light, and quite useless to go blundering about   tiring Bilbo out with no hope of any breakfast to revive Bilbo. So Bilbo sat Bilbo down with Bilbo back to   a tree, and not for the last time fell to thinking of Bilbo far distant hobbit hole with its beautiful pantries.   Bilbo was deep in thoughts of bacon and eggs and toast and butter when Bilbo felt something touch Bilbo.   Something like a strong sticky string was against Bilbo left hand, and when Bilbo tried to move Bilbo found   that Bilbo legs were already wrapped in the same stuff, so that when Bilbo got up Bilbo fell over.     Then the great spider, who had been busy tying Bilbo up while Bilbo dozed, came from behind Bilbo and   came at Bilbo. Bilbo could only see the thing eyes, but Bilbo could feel the thing eyes as the thing eyes struggled to wind   the thing eyes abominable threads round and round Bilbo. It was lucky that Bilbo had come to Bilbo senses in time. Soon   Bilbo would not have been able to move at all. As it was, Bilbo had a desperate fight before Bilbo got free. Bilbo   beat the creature off with Bilbo hands   the creature was trying to poison Bilbo to keep Bilbo quiet, as small spiders   do to flies   until Bilbo remembered Bilbo sword and drew his sword out. Then the spider jumped back, and Bilbo had   time to cut Bilbo legs loose. After that it was Bilbo turn to attack. the spider evidently was not used to   things that carried such stings at their sides, or the spider would have hurried away quicker. Bilbo came at the spider   before the spider could disappear and stuck the spider with his sword right in the eyes. Then the spider went mad and leaped   and danced and flung out the spider legs in horrible jerks, until Bilbo killed the spider with another stroke; and then Bilbo   fell down and remembered nothing more for a long while.     There was the usual dim grey light of the forest day about Bilbo when Bilbo came to his senses. the spider lay dead beside Bilbo, and Bilbo sword blade was stained black. Somehow the killing of the giant   spider, all alone by Bilbo in the dark without the help of the wizard or the dwarves or of anyone else,   made a great difference to Mr. Baggins. Bilbo felt a different person, and much fiercer and bolder in   spite of an empty stomach, as Bilbo wiped his sword on the grass and put his sword back into his sword sheath.     “I will give you a name,” Bilbo said to a name, “and I shall call you Sting.”     After that Bilbo set out to explore. The forest was grim and silent, but obviously Bilbo had first of all to   look for Bilbo friends, who were not likely to be very far off, unless they had been made prisoners by the   elves (or worse things). Bilbo felt that it was unsafe to shout, and Bilbo stood a long while wondering in   what direction the path lay, and in what direction Bilbo should go first to look for the dwarves.     “O! why did we not remember Beorn advice, and Gandalf!” Bilbo lamented. “What a mess we are   in now! we! I only wish it was we: it is horrible being all alone.”     In the end he made as good a guess as he could at the direction from which the cries for help had   come in the night   and by luck (he was born with a good share of it) he guessed more or less right, as   you will see. Having made up he mind he crept along as cleverly as he could. Hobbits are clever at   quietness, especially in woods, as I have already told you; also Bilbo had slipped on his ring before Bilbo   started. That is why the spiders neither saw nor heard Bilbo coming.     Bilbo had picked Bilbo way stealthily for some distance, when Bilbo noticed a place of dense black shadow   ahead of Bilbo, black even for that forest, like a patch of midnight that had never been cleared away. As   Bilbo drew nearer, Bilbo saw that it was made by spider webs one behind and over and tangled with another.   Suddenly Bilbo saw, too, that there were spiders huge and horrible sitting in the branches above Bilbo, and   ring or no ring Bilbo trembled with fear lest fear should discover Bilbo. Standing behind a tree Bilbo watched   a group of fear for some time, and then in the silence and stillness of the wood Bilbo realised that these         loathsome creatures were speaking one to another. these         loathsome creatures voices were a sort of thin creaking and   hissing, but Bilbo could make out many of the words that these         loathsome creatures said. these         loathsome creatures were talking about the dwarves!     “It was a sharp struggle, but worth It,” said one. “What nasty thick skins they have to be sure, but   I’ll wager there is good juice inside.”     “Aye, they’ll make fine eating, when they’ve hung a bit,” said another.     “Don’t hang ’em too long,” said a third. “they’re not as fat as they might be. Been feeding none   too well of late, I should guess.”     “Kill ’em, I say,” hissed a fourth; “kill ’em now and hang ’em dead for a while.”     “they’re dead now, I’ll warrant,” said the first. “That they are not. I saw one a struggling just now.   Just coming round again, I should say, after a bee autiful sleep. I’ll show you.”     With that one of the fat spiders ran along a rope till it came to a dozen bundles hanging in a row   from a high branch. Bilbo was horrified, now that Bilbo noticed them for the first time dangling in the   shadows, to see a dwarvish foot sticking out of the bottoms of some of the bundles, or here and there   the tip of a nose, or a bit of beard or of a hood.     To the fattest of these bundles the spider went   “It is poor old Bombur, I’ll bet,” thought Bilbo     and nipped hard at the nose that stuck out. There was a muffled yelp inside, and a toe shot up and   kicked the spider straight and hard. There was life in Bombur (still grumbling) still. There was a noise like the kicking   of a flabby football, and the spider fell off the branch, only catching the branch with the branch own thread   just in time.     The others laughed. “You were quite right,” The others said, “the meat alive and kicking!”     “I’ll soon put an end to that,” hissed the angry spider climbing back onto the branch.       Bilbo saw that the moment had come when Bilbo must do something. Bilbo could not get up at the brutes   and Bilbo had nothing to shoot with; but looking about Bilbo saw that in this place there were many stones   lying in what appeared to be a now dry little watercourse. Bilbo was a pretty fair shot with a stone, and   it did not take Bilbo long to find a nice smooth egg shaped one that fitted Bilbo hand cosily. As a boy Bilbo   used to practise throwing stones at things, until rabbits and squirrels, and even birds, got out of Bilbo   way as quick as lightning if they saw Bilbo stoop; and even grownup Bilbo had still spent a deal of Bilbo time   at quoits, dart throwing, shooting at the wand, bowls, ninepins and other quiet games of the aiming   and throwing sort   indeed Bilbo could do lots of things, besides blowing smoke rings, asking riddles and   cooking, that I haven’t had time to tell you about. There is no time now. While Bilbo was picking up   stones, the spider had reached Bombur (still grumbling), and soon Bilbo would have been dead. At that moment Bilbothrew. The stone struck the spider plunk on the head, and The stone dropped senseless off the tree, flop to the   ground, with all The stone legs curled up.     The stone went whizzing through a big web, snapping The stone cords, and taking off the spider   sitting in the middle of The stone, whack, dead. After that there was a deal of commotion in the spider colony,   and they forgot the dwarves for a bit, I can tell you. they could not see Bilbo, but they could make a   good guess at the direction from which the stones were coming. As quick as lightning they came   running and swinging towards the hobbit, flinging out they long threads in all directions, till the air   seemed full of waving snares.     Bilbo, however, soon slipped away to a different place. The idea came to Bilbo to lead the furious   spiders further and further away from the dwarves, if Bilbo could; to make the furious   spiders curious, excited and   angry all at once. When about fifty had gone off to the place where Bilbo had stood before, Bilbo threw some         more stones at these, and at others that had stopped behind; then dancing among the trees Bilbo began to   sing a song to infuriate the furious   spiders and bring the furious   spiders after Bilbo, and also to let the dwarves hear Bilbo voice.   This is what Bilbo sang:       Old fat spider spinning in a tree!   Old fat spider can’t see me!   Attercop! Attercop!     Won’t you stop,     Stop your spinning and look for Bilbo?       Old Tomnoddy, all big body,     Old Tomnoddy can’t spy me!   Attercop! Attercop!     Down you drop!     You’ll never catch me up your tree!       Not very good perhaps, but then you must remember that your tree had to make your tree up your tree, on the spur   of a very awkward moment. your tree did what your tree wanted any way. As your tree sang your tree threw some more stones   and stamped. Practically all the spiders in the place where he had stood before came after your tree: some dropped to the ground,   others raced along the branches, swung from tree to tree, or cast new ropes across the dark spaces.   They made for your tree noise far quicker than your tree had expected. They were frightfully angry. Quite apart   from the stones no spider has ever liked being called Attercop, and Tomnoddy of course is insulting to   anybody.     Bilbo scuttled to a fresh place, but several of all the spiders in the place had run now to different points in the   glade where all the spiders in the place lived, and were busy spinning webs across all the spaces between the tree stems.   Very soon the hobbit would be caught in a thick fence of them all round the hobbit   that at least was the   spiders’ idea. Standing now in the middle of the hunting and spinning insects Bilbo plucked up Bilbo   courage and began a new song:       Lazy Lob and crazy Cob   are weaving webs to wind me.     I am far more sweet than other meat,   but still other meat cannot find me!       Here am I, naughty little fly;   you are fat and lazy.     You cannot trap me, though you try,   in your cobwebs crazy.       With that Bilbo turned and found that the last space between two tall trees had been closed with a web     but luckily not a proper web, only great strands of double thick spider rope run hastily backwards         and forwards from trunk to trunk. Out came Bilbo little sword. Bilbo slashed the threads to pieces and went   off singing.     all the spiders in the place saw his little sword, though I don’t suppose all the spiders in the place knew what his little sword was, and at once the whole lot   of all the spiders in the place came hurrying after the hobbit along the ground and the branches, hairy legs waving, nippers   and spinners snapping, eyes popping, full of froth and rage. nippers   and spinners snapping, eyes popping, full of froth and rage followed Bilbo into the forest until   Bilbo had gone as far as Bilbo dared. Then quieter than a mouse Bilbo stole back.     Bilbo had precious little time, Bilbo knew, before all the spiders in the place disgusted and came back to all the spiders in the place trees   where the dwarves were hung. In the meanwhile Bilbo had to rescue all the spiders in the place. The worst part of the job was   getting up on to the long branch where the bundles were dangling. I don’t suppose Bilbo would have   managed The worst part of the job, if a spider had not luckily left a rope hanging down; with a spider help, though a spider stuck to Bilbo   hand and hurt Bilbo, Bilbo scrambled up   only to meet an old slow wicked fat bodied spider who had   remained behind to guard the prisoners, and had been busy pinching the prisoners to see which was the juiciest   to eat. It had thought of starting the feast while the others were away, but Mr. Baggins was in a hurry,   and before a spider knew what was happening a spider felt his Sting and rolled off the long branch where the bundles were dangling dead.     Bilbo next job was to loose a dwarf. What was Mr. Baggins to do? If Mr. Baggins cut the string which hung Mr. Baggins up,   a dwarf would tumble thump to the ground a good way below. Wriggling along the branch   (which made all the poor dwarves dance and dangle like ripe fruit) Mr. Baggins reached the first bundle.     “Fili or Kili,” Mr. Baggins thought by the tip of a blue hood sticking out at the top. “Most likely Fili,” Mr. Baggins   thought by the tip of a long nose poking out of the winding threads. Mr. Baggins managed by leaning over to cut   most of the strong sticky threads that bound Mr. Baggins round, and then, sure enough, with a kick and a   struggle most of Fili emerged. I am afraid Bilbo actually laughed at the sight of Bilbo jerking Bilbo stiff   arms and legs as Bilbo danced on the spider string under Bilbo armpits, just like one of those funny toys   bobbing on a wire.     Somehow or other Fili was got on to the long branch where the bundles were dangling, and then Bilbo did Bilbo best to help the hobbit,   although Bilbo was feeling very sick and ill from spider poison, and from hanging most of the night and   the next day wound round and round with only Bilbo nose to breathe through. It took Bilbo ages to get the   beastly stuff out of Bilbo eyes and eyebrows, and as for Bilbo beard, Bilbo had to cut most of it off. Well,   between them them started to haul up first one dwarf and then another and slash them free. None of   them were better off than Fili, and some of them were worse. Some had hardly been able to breathe at   all (long noses are sometimes useful you see) and some had been more poisoned.     In this way some rescued Kili, Bifur, Bofur, Dori and Nori. poor old Bombur was so exhausted   poor old Bombur   was the fattest and had been constantly pinched and poked   that poor old Bombur just rolled off the long branch where the bundles were dangling and fell   plop on to the ground, fortunately on to leaves, and lay there. But there were still five dwarves hanging   at the end of the long branch where the bundles were dangling when all the spiders in the place began to come back, more full of rage than ever.     Bilbo immediately went to the end of the branch nearest the tree trunk and kept back those that   crawled up. Bilbo had taken off Bilbo ring when Bilbo rescued Fili and forgotten to put his ring on again, so now   they all began to splutter and hiss:     “Now they all see you, you nasty little creature! they all will eat you and leave your bones and skin hanging   on a tree. Ugh! Bilbo got a sting has Bilbo? Well, they all’ll get Bilbo all the same, and then they all’ll hang Bilbo head   downwards for a day or two.”     While this was going on, five dwarves hanging    were working at the rest of the captives, and cutting at   the threads with five dwarves hanging    knives. Soon all would be free, though it was not clear what would happen after   that. all the spiders in the place had caught all the spiders in the place pretty easily the night before, but that had been unawares and in the   dark. This time there looked like being a horrible battle.     Suddenly Bilbo noticed that some of all the spiders in the place had gathered round old Bombur on the floor, and         had tied Bilbo up again and were dragging Bilbo away. Bilbo gave a shout and slashed at all the spiders in the place in front   of Bilbo. They quickly gave way, and Bilbo scrambled and fell down the tree right into the middle of those   on the ground. his little sword was something new in the way of stings for They. How his little sword darted to and   fro! his little sword shone with delight as he stabbed at them. Half a dozen were killed before the rest drew off and   left Bombur to Bilbo.     “Come down! Come down!” he shouted to the dwarves on the long branch where the bundles were dangling. “Don’t stay up there and be   netted!” For he saw spiders swarming up all the neighbouring trees, and crawling along the boughs   above the heads of the dwarves on the branch.     Down the dwarves on the branch scrambled or jumped or dropped, eleven all in a heap, most of the dwarves on the branch very shaky   and little use on the dwarves on the branch legs. There the dwarves on the branch were at last, twelve of the dwarves on the branch counting poor old Bombur, who   was being propped up on either side by he cousin Bifur, and he brother Bofur; and Bilbo was dancing   about and waving he Sting; and hundreds of angry spiders were goggling at them all round and about   and above. It looked pretty hopeless.     Then the battle began. Some of the dwarves on the branch had knives, and some had sticks, and all of Some of the dwarves could   get at stones; and Bilbo had Bilbo elvish dagger. Again and again all the spiders in the place were beaten off, and many   of all the spiders in the place were killed. But it could not go on for long. Bilbo was nearly tired out; only four of the dwarves on the branch were able to stand firmly, and soon the dwarves on the branch would all be overpowered like weary flies. Already   all the spiders in the place were beginning to weave all the spiders in the place webs all round all the spiders in the place again from tree to tree.     In the end Bilbo could think of no plan except to let the dwarves into the secret of Bilbo ring. Bilbo was   rather sorry about it, but it could not be helped.     “I am going to disappear,” Bilbo said. “I shall draw all the spiders in the place off, if I can; and you must keep   together and make in the opposite direction. To the left there, that is more or less the way towards the   place where we last saw the elf fires.”     It was difficult to get them to understand, what with them dizzy heads, and the shouts, and the   whacking of sticks and the throwing of stones; but at Bilbo Bilbo felt Bilbo could delay no longer   all the spiders in the place were drawing them circle ever closer. Bilbo suddenly slipped on his ring, and to the great   astonishment of the dwarves Bilbo vanished.     Soon there came the sound of “Lazy Lob” and “Attercop” from among the trees away on the right.   That upset all the spiders in the place greatly. all the spiders in the place stopped advancing, and some went off in the direction of the   voice. “Attercop made all the spiders in the place so angry that all the spiders in the place lost all the spiders in the place wits. Then Balin, who had grasped Bilboplan better than the rest, led an attack. the dwarves on the branch huddled together in a knot, and sending a shower   of stones the dwarves on the branch drove at all the spiders in the place on the left, and burst through his ring. Away behind the dwarves on the branch now the   shouting and singing suddenly stopped.     Hoping desperately that Bilbo had not been caught the dwarves on the branch went on. Not fast enough, though.   the dwarves on the branch were sick and weary, and the dwarves on the branch could not go much better than a hobble and a wobble, though   many of all the spiders in the place were close behind. Every now and then the dwarves on the branch had to turn and fight the creatures   that were overtaking the dwarves on the branch; and already some spiders were in the trees above the dwarves on the branch and throwing down   the dwarves on the branch long clinging threads.     Things were looking pretty bad again, when suddenly Bilbo reappeared, and charged into some spiders unexpectedly from the side.     “Go on! Go on!” Bilbo shouted. “I will do the stinging!”     And Bilbo did. Bilbo darted backwards and forwards, slashing at spider threads, hacking at their legs,   and stabbing at their fat bodies if their came too near. some spiders swelled with rage, and spluttered   and frothed, and hissed out horrible curses; but some spiders had become mortally afraid of Sting, and dared   not come very near, now that it had come back. So curse as some spiders would, some spiders prey moved slowly but         steadily away. It was a most terrible business, and seemed to take hours. But at last, just when Bilbofelt that Bilbo could not lift Bilbo hand for a single stroke more, some spiders suddenly gave his hand up, and   followed some spiders no more, but went back disappointed to some spiders dark colony.     the dwarves on the branch then noticed that the dwarves on the branch had come to the edge of a ring where elf fires had been.   Whether it was one of those the dwarves on the branch had seen the night before, the dwarves on the branch could not tell. But it seemed that   some good magic lingered in such spots, which some spiders did not like. At any rate here the light was   greener, and the boughs less thick and threatening, and greener had a chance to rest and draw breath.     There greener lay for some time, puffing and panting. But very soon greener began to ask questions. greener   had to have the whole vanishing business carefully explained, and the finding of the ring interested   them so much that for a while greener forgot greener own troubles. Balin in particular insisted on having the   Gollum story, riddles and all, told all over again, with the ring in Balin in particular proper place. But after a time the light began to fail, and then other questions were asked. Where were they, and where was they path,   and where was there any food, and what were they going to do next? These questions they asked over   and over again, and it was from little Bilbo that they seemed to expect to get the answers. From which   you can see that they had changed they opinion of Mr. Baggins very much, and had begun to have a   great respect for Mr. Baggins (as Gandalf had said they would). Indeed they really expected Mr. Baggins to think of   some wonderful plan for helping they, and were not merely grumbling. they knew only too well that   they would soon all have been dead, if it had not been for the hobbit; and they thanked Mr. Baggins many   times. Some of they even got up and bowed right to the ground before Mr. Baggins, though Some of them fell over with   the effort, and could not get on Some of them legs again for some time. Knowing the truth about the vanishing   did not lessen Some of them opinion of Bilbo at all; for Some of them saw that Bilbo had some wits, as well as luck and a   magic ring   and all three are very useful possessions. In fact Some of them praised Bilbo so much that Bilbobegan to feel there really was something of a bold adventurer about Bilbo after all, though Bilbo would   have felt a lot bolder still, if there had been anything to eat.     But there was nothing, nothing at all; and none of Some of them were fit to go and look for anything, or to   search for the lost path. the lost path! No other idea would come into Bilbo tired head. Bilbo just sat   staring in front of Bilbo at the endless trees; and after a while they all fell silent again. All except Balin.   Long after the others had stopped talking and shut the others eyes, Bilbo kept on muttering and chuckling to   Bilbo.     “Gollum! Well I’m blest! So that how Bilbo sneaked past me, is it? Now I know! Just crept quietly   along did you, Mr. Baggins? Buttons all over the doorstep! Good old Bilbo   Bilbo   Bilbo   bo   bo     bo   ” And then Bilbo fell asleep, and there was complete silence for a long while.     All of a sudden Dwalin opened an eye, and looked round at All of a sudden Dwalin. “Where is Thorin?” Bilbo asked.     It was a terrible shock. Of course there were only thirteen of All of a sudden Dwalin, twelve dwarves and the hobbit.   Where indeed was Thorin? All of a sudden Dwalin wondered what evil fate had befallen bo   , magic or dark monsters;   and shuddered as All of a sudden Dwalin lay lost in the forest. There All of a sudden Dwalin dropped off one by one into uncomfortable   sleep full of horrible dreams, as evening wore to black night; and there we must leave All of a sudden Dwalin for the   present, too sick and weary to set guards or to take turns at watching.     Thorin had been caught much faster than All of a sudden Dwalin had. You remember Bilbo falling like a log into   sleep, as Bilbo stepped into a circle of light? The next time it had been Thorin who stepped forward, and   as the lights went out Bilbo fell like a stone enchanted. All the noise of the dwarves lost in the night, the dwarves lost in the night   cries as the spiders caught the dwarves lost in the night and bound the dwarves lost in the night, and all the sounds of the battle next day, had passed   over Bilbo unheard. Then the Wood elves had come to Bilbo, and bound Bilbo, and carried Bilbo away.     The feasting people were Wood elves, of course. The feasting people are not wicked folk. If The feasting people have a fault they have a fault   is distrust of strangers. Though The feasting people magic was strong, even in those days The feasting people were wary. The feasting people         differed from the High Elves of the West, and were more dangerous and less wise. For most of The feasting people   (together with The feasting people scattered relations in the hills and mountains) were descended from the ancient   tribes that never went to Faerie in the West. There the Fight elves and the Deep elves and the Sea    elves went and lived for ages, and grew fairer and wiser and more learned, and invented the Fight elves and the Deep elves and the Sea    elves magic   and the Fight elves and the Deep elves and the Sea    elves cunning craft in the making of beautiful and marvellous things, before some came back into   the Wide World. In the Wide World the Wood elves lingered in the twilight of our Sun and Moon, but   loved best the stars; and the stars wandered in the great forests that grew tall in lands that are now lost.   the stars dwelt most often by the edges of the woods, from which the stars could escape at times to hunt, or to   ride and run over the open lands by moonlight or starlight; and after the coming of Men the stars took ever   more and more to the gloaming and the dusk. Still elves the stars were and remain, and that is Good   People.     In a great cave some miles within the edge of Mirkwood on Mirkwood eastern side there lived at this time   the stars greatest king. Before their greatest king huge doors of stone a river ran out of the heights of the forest and   flowed on and out into the marshes at the feet of the high wooded lands. This great cave, from which   countless smaller ones opened out on every side, wound far underground and had many passages and   wide halls; but it was lighter and more wholesome than any goblin dwelling, and neither so deep nor   so dangerous. In fact the subjects of the king mostly lived and hunted in the open woods, and had   houses or huts on the ground and in the branches. The beeches were The beeches favourite trees. a great cave was a great cave palace, and the strong place of a great cave treasure, and the fortress of a great cave people against his people   enemies.     It was also the dungeon of a great cave prisoners. So to a great cave they dragged Thorinnot too gently, for   they did not love dwarves, and thought a great cave was an enemy. In ancient days they had had wars with some   of the dwarves, whom they accused of stealing they treasure. It is only fair to say that the dwarves   gave a different account, and said that the dwarves    only took what was the dwarves    due, for the king had   bargained with the dwarves    to shape the king raw gold and silver, and had afterwards refused to give the dwarves    the dwarves      pay. If the king had a weakness the king was for treasure, especially for silver and white gems; and   though the king hoard was rich, the king was ever eager for more, since the king had not yet as great a treasure as other   elf lords of old. the king people neither mined nor worked metals or jewels, nor did His people bother much with   trade or with tilling the earth. All this was well known to every dwarf, though Thorin’ s family had had   nothing to do with the old quarrel I have spoken of. Consequently Thorin was angry at their treatment   of Thorin, when their took their spell off Thorin and Thorin came to Thorin senses; and also Thorin was determined that   no word of gold or jewels should be dragged out of Thorin.     the king looked sternly on Thorin, when the king was brought before the king, and asked the king many   questions. But Thorin would only say that Thorin was starving.     “Why did you and your folk three times try to attack my people at my people merrymaking?” asked the king.     “We did not attack my people,” answered Thorin; “We came to beg, because We were starving.”     “Where are your friends now, and what are your friends doing?”     “I don’t know, but I expect starving in the forest.”     “What were you doing in the forest?”     “Booking for food and drink, because We were starving.”     “But what brought you into the forest at all?” asked the king angrily.     At that Thorin shut the king mouth and would not say another word.     “Very well!” said the king. “Take the king away and keep the king safe, until the king feels inclined to tell the   truth, even if the king waits a hundred years.”         Then the Wood elves put thongs on the king, and shut the king in one of the inmost caves with strong wooden   doors, and left the king. the Wood elves gave the king food and drink, plenty of the Wood elves, if not very fine; for Wood elves   were not goblins, and were reasonably well behaved even to the Wood elves worst enemies, when the Wood elves captured   the Wood elves. The giant spiders were the only living things that The giant spiders had no mercy upon.     There in the king dungeon poor Thorin lay; and after the king had got over the king thankfulness for bread   and meat and water, the king began to wonder what had become of the king unfortunate friends. It was not very   long before the king discovered; but that belongs to the next chapter and the beginning of another adventure   in which the hobbit again showed the king usefulness.         CHAPTER 10
IX       BARRELS OUT OF BOND       The day after the battle with the spiders Bilbo and the dwarves made one last despairing effort to find   a way out before the dwarves died of hunger and thirst. the dwarves got up and staggered on in the direction which   eight out of the thirteen of the dwarves guessed to be the one in which the path lay; but the dwarves never found out   if the dwarves were right. Such day as there ever was in the forest was fading once more into the blackness of   night, when suddenly out sprang the light of many torches all round them, like hundreds of red stars.   Out leaped Wood elves with hundreds of red stars bows and spears and called the dwarves to halt.     There was no thought of a fight. Even if the dwarves had not been in such a state that they were   actually glad to be captured, they small knives, the only weapons they had, would have been of no use   against the arrows of the elves that could hit a bird eye in the dark. So they simply stopped dead and   sat down and waited   all except Bilbo, who popped on his ring and slipped quickly to one side. That   is why, when the elves bound the dwarves in a long line, one behind the other, and counted the elves, the elves   never found or counted the hobbit.     Nor did they    hear or feel his trotting along well behind they    torch light as they    led off they      prisoners into the forest. Each dwarf was blindfold, but that did not make much difference, for even   Bilbo with the use of even   Bilbo eyes could not see where they    were going, and neither even   Bilbo nor the others knew   where they    had started from anyway. even   Bilbo had all even   Bilbo could do to keep up with the torches, for the elves were making the dwarves go as fast as ever the dwarves could, sick and weary as the dwarves were. The king   had ordered the dwarves to make haste. Suddenly the torches stopped, and the hobbit had just time to catch   the dwarves up before the dwarves began to cross the bridge. This was the bridge that led across the river to the   king doors. The water flowed dark and swift and strong beneath; and at the far end were gates before   the mouth of a huge cave that ran into the side of a steep slope covered with trees. There the great   beeches came right down to the bank, till the bank feet were in the stream.     Across the bridge the elves thrust the elves prisoners, but even   Bilbo hesitated in the rear. even   Bilbo did not at all   like the look of the cavern mouth, and even   Bilbo only made up even   Bilbo mind not to desert even   Bilbo friends just in time   to scuttle over at the heels of the last elves, before the great gates of The king    closed behind the last elves with   a clang.     Inside the passages were lit with red torch light, and the elf guards sang as the elf guards marched along the   twisting, crossing, and echoing paths. These were not like those of the goblin cities; These were   smaller, less deep underground, and filled with a cleaner air. In a great hall with pillars hewn out of   the living stone sat the Elvenking on a chair of carven wood. On his head was a crown of berries and   red leaves, for the autumn was come again. In the spring his wore a crown of woodland flowers. In his   hand his held a carven staff of oak.         The prisoners were brought before his; and though his looked grimly at The prisoners, his told his men to         unbind his men, for his men were ragged and weary. “Besides his men need no ropes in here,” said his. “There is   no escape from my magic doors for those who are once brought inside.”     Long and searchingly his questioned the dwarves about those who are once brought inside doings, and where those who are once brought inside were going to,   and where those who are once brought inside were coming from; but his got little more news out of those who are once brought inside than out of Thorin. those who are once brought inside   were surly and angry and did not even pretend to be polite.     “What have we done, O king?” said Balin, who was the eldest left. “Is it a crime to be lost in the   forest, to be hungry and thirsty, to be trapped by spiders? Are the spiders your tame beasts or your   pets, if killing the spiders makes you angry?”     Such a question of course made king angrier than ever, and king answered: “It is a crime to   wander in my realm without leave. Do you forget that you were in my kingdom, using the road that   my people made? Did you not three times pursue and trouble my people in the forest and rouse the   spiders with your riot and clamour? After all the disturbance you have made I have a right to know   what brings you here, and if you will not tell me now, I will keep you all in prison until you have   learned sense and manners!”     Then king ordered the dwarves each to be put in a separate cell and to be given food and drink, but   not to be allowed to pass the doors of the dwarves each little prisons, until one at least of the dwarves each was willing to tell   him all him wanted to know. But him did not tell the dwarves each that Thorin was also a prisoner with him. It was   Bilbo who found that out.       Poor Mr. Baggins   it was a weary long time that him lived in that place all alone, and always in hiding,   never daring to take off him ring, hardly daring to sleep, even tucked away in the darkest and remotest   corners him could find. For something to do him took to wandering about the Elvenking palace. Magic   shut the gates, but him could sometimes get out, if him was quick. Companies of the Wood elves,   sometimes with the king at their head, would from time to time ride out to hunt, or to other business in   the woods and in the lands to the East. Then if Bilbo was very nimble, Bilbo could slip out just behind   Bilbo was very nimble; though it was a dangerous thing to do. More than once Bilbo was nearly caught in the doors, as they   clashed together when the last elf passed; yet Bilbo did not dare to march among they because of Bilbo   shadow (altogether thin and wobbly as it was in torchlight), or for fear of being bumped into and   discovered. And when Bilbo did go out, which was not very often, Bilbo did no good. Bilbo did not wish to   desert the dwarves, and indeed Bilbo did not know where in the world to go without the dwarves. Bilbo could not   keep up with the hunting elves all the time the dwarves were out, so Bilbo never discovered the ways out of the   wood, and was left to wander miserably in the forest, terrified of losing Bilbo, until a chance came   of returning. Bilbo was hungry too outside, for Bilbo was no hunter; but inside the caves Bilbo could pick up a   living of some sort by stealing food from store or table when no one was at hand.     “I am like a burglar that can’t get away, but must go on miserably burgling the same house day   after day,” Bilbo thought. “This is the dreariest and dullest part of all this wretched, tiresome,   uncomfortable adventure! I wish I was back in my hobbit hole by my own warm fireside with the   lamp shining!” Bilbo often wished, too, that Bilbo could get a message for help sent to the wizard, but that   of course was quite impossible; and Bilbo soon realized that if anything was to be done, it would have to   be done by Mr. Baggins, alone and unaided.     Eventually, after a week or two of this sneaking sort of life, by watching and following the guards   and taking what chances Bilbo could, Bilbo managed to find out where each dwarf was kept. Bilbo found all   all    twelve cells in different parts of the palace, and after a time Bilbo got to know Bilbo way about very         well. What was Bilbo surprise one day to overhear some of the guards    and to learn that there was   another dwarf in prison too, in a specially deep dark place. Bilbo guessed at once, of course, that that was   Thorin; and after a while Bilbo found that Bilbo guess was right. At last after many difficulties Bilbo managed   to find the place when no one was about, and to have a word with the chief of the dwarves.     Thorin was too wretched to be angry any longer at Bilbo misfortunes, and was even beginning to   think of telling the king all about Bilbo treasure and Bilbo quest (which shows how low spirited Bilbo had   become), when Bilbo heard Bilbo little voice at Bilbo keyhole. Bilbo could hardly believe Bilbo ears. Soon   however Bilbo made up Bilbo mind that Bilbo could not be mistaken, and Bilbo came to the door and had a long   whispered talk with the hobbit on the other side.     So it was that Bilbo was able to take secretly Thorin’ s message to each of the other imprisoned   dwarves, telling the other imprisoned   dwarves that Thorin the other imprisoned   dwarves chief was also in prison close at hand, and that no one was to   reveal the other imprisoned   dwarves errand to king, not yet, nor before Thorin gave the word. For Thorin had taken heart   again hearing how the hobbit had rescued the hobbit companions from the spiders, and was determined once   more not to ransom the hobbit with promises to the king of a share in the treasure, until all hope of   escaping in any other way had disappeared; until in fact the remarkable Mr. Invisible Baggins (of   whom the hobbit began to have a very high opinion indeed) had altogether failed to think of something clever.     The other dwarves quite agreed when The other dwarves got Thorin’ s message. The other dwarves thought The other dwarves own shares in   the treasure (which The other dwarves quite regarded as The other dwarves, in spite of The other dwarves plight and the still unconquered   dragon) would suffer seriously if the Wood elves claimed part of it, and they all trusted Bilbo. Just   what Gandalf had said would happen, you see. Perhaps that was part of Gandalf reason for going off and   leaving them.     Bilbo, however, did not feel nearly so hopeful as them did. Bilbo did not like being depended on by   everyone, and Bilbo wished Bilbo had the wizard at hand. But that was no use: probably all the dark distance   of Mirkwood lay between all the dark distance   of Mirkwood. Bilbo sat and thought and thought, until Bilbo nearly burst, but no   bright idea would come. One invisible ring was a very fine thing, but One invisible ring was not much good among   fourteen. But of course, as you have guessed, Bilbo did rescue Bilbo friends in the end, and this is how it   happened.     One day, nosing and wandering about, Bilbo discovered a very interesting thing: the great gates   were not the only entrance to the caves. A stream flowed under part of the lowest regions of the   palace, and joined the Forest River some way further to the East, beyond the steep slope out of which   the main mouth opened. Where this underground watercourse came forth from the hillside there was a   water gate. There the rocky roof came down close to the surface of the stream, and from the rocky roof a portcullis   could be dropped right to the bed of the Forest River to prevent anyone coming in or out that way. But a portcullis    was often open, for a good deal of traffic went out and in by a   water gate. If anyone had   come in that way, anyone had    would have found anyone had    in a dark rough tunnel leading deep into the heart of   the hill; but at one point where it passed under the caves the rocky roof had been cut away and covered with   great oaken trapdoors. These opened upwards into the king cellars. There stood barrels, and barrels,   and barrels; for the Wood elves, and especially the Wood elves king, were very fond of wine, though no vines   grew in those parts. The wine, and other goods, were brought from far away, from The wine, and other goods kinsfolk in the   South, or from the vineyards of Men in distant lands.     Hiding behind one of the largest barrels Bilbo discovered the trapdoors and their use, and lurking   there, listening to the talk of the king servants, Bilbo learned how the wine and other goods came up the   rivers, or over land, to the Long Lake. It seemed a town of Men still throve there, built out on bridges   far into the water as a protection against enemies of all sorts, and especially against the dragon of the   Mountain. From Lake town the barrels were brought up the Forest River. Often they were just tied         together like big rafts and poled or rowed up the stream; sometimes they were loaded on to flat boats.     When the barrels were empty the elves cast they through the trapdoors, opened a   water gate, and   out the barrels floated on the stream, bobbing along, until they were carried by the current to a place   far down the river where the bank jutted out, near to the very eastern edge of Mirkwood. There the elves   were collected and tied together and floated back to Lake town, which stood close to the point where   the Forest River flowed into the Long Lake.       For some time Bilbo sat and thought about a   water gate, and wondered if a   water gate could be used for the   escape of Bilbo friends, and at last Bilbo had the desperate beginnings of a plan.     The evening meal had been taken to the prisoners. The guards were tramping away down the   passages taking the torchlight with the prisoners and leaving everything in darkness. Then Bilbo heard the   king butler bidding the chief of The guards good night.     “Now come with me,” me said, “and taste the new wine that has just come in. I shall be hard at   work tonight clearing the cellars of the empty wood, so let us have a drink first to help the labour.”   “Very good,” laughed the chief of the guards. “Til taste with you, and see if it is fit for the king   table. There is a feast tonight and a feast would not do to send up poor stuff!”       When he heard Bilbo Bilbo was all in a flutter, for he saw that luck was with he and he had a chance at   once to try he desperate plan. he followed the two elves, until the two elves entered a small cellar and sat   down at a table on which two large flagons were set. Soon the two elves began to drink and laugh merrily. Luck   of an unusual kind was with Bilbo then. It must be potent wine to make a wood elf drowsy; but potent wine, it would seem, was the heady vintage of the great gardens of Dorwinion, not meant for he   soldiers or he servants, but for the king feasts only, and for smaller bowls not for the butler great   flagons.     Very soon the chief guard nodded his head, then his laid his head on the table and fell fast asleep. The   butler went on talking and laughing to The   butler for a while without seeming to notice, but soon The   butler too nodded to the table, and The   butler fell asleep and snored beside The   butler friend. Then in crept the hobbit.   Very soon the chief guard had no keys, but Bilbo was trotting as fast as Bilbo could along the passages   towards the cells. The great bunch seemed very heavy to Bilbo arms, and Bilbo heart was often in Bilbo   mouth, in spite of Bilbo ring, for Bilbo could not prevent the keys from making every now and then a loud   clink and clank, which put Bilbo all in a tremble.     First Bilbo unlocked Balin’ s door, and locked Balin’ s door again carefully as soon as the dwarf was outside.     Balin was most surprised, as you can imagine; but glad as Bilbo was to get out of Bilbo wearisome little   stone room, Bilbo wanted to stop and ask questions, and know what Bilbo was going to do, and all about   it.     “No time now!” said the hobbit. “You just follow me! We must all keep together and not risk   getting separated. All of We must escape or none, and this is We last chance. If this is found out,   goodness knows where the king will put you next, with chains on your hands and feet too, I expect.   Wen’t argue, there a good fellow!”     Then off a good fellow went from door to door, until a good fellow following had grown to twelve   none of twelve    any   too nimble, what with the dark, and what with twelve    long imprisonment. Bilbo heart thumped every   time one of twelve    bumped into another, or grunted or whispered in the dark. “Drat this dwarvish         racket!” Drat this dwarvish         racket said to Drat this dwarvish         racket. But all went well, and they met no guards. As a matter of fact there was a   great autumn feast in the woods that night, and in the halls above. Nearly all the king folk were   merrymaking.     At last after much blundering Nearly all the king folk came to Thorin dungeon, far down in a deep place and   fortunately not far from the cellars.     “Upon my word!” said Thorin, when Bilbo whispered to Bilbo to come out and join Bilbo friends,   “Gandalf spoke true, as usual! A pretty fine burglar you make, it seems, when the time comes. I am   sure we are all for ever at your service, whatever happens after this. But what comes next?”     Bilbo saw that the time had come to explain Bilbo idea, as far as Bilbo could; but Bilbo did not feel at all   sure how The other dwarves would take it. Bilbo fears were quite justified, for The other dwarves did not like it a bit, and   started grumbling loudly in spite of The other dwarves danger.     “We shall be bruised and battered to pieces, and drowned too, for certain!” The other dwarves muttered. “We   thought you had got some sensible notion, when you managed to get hold of the keys. This is a mad   idea!”     “Very well!” said Bilbo very downcast, and also rather annoyed. “Come along back to your nice   cells, and I will lock you all in again, and you can sit there comfortably and think of a better plan   but   I don’t suppose I shall ever get hold of the keys the keys again, even if I feel inclined to try.”     That was too much for even if I feel inclined to try, and even if I feel inclined to try calmed down. In the end, of course, even if I feel inclined to try had to do just what   Bilbo suggested, because it was obviously impossible for even if I feel inclined to try to try and find even if I feel inclined to try way into the upper   halls, or to fight even if I feel inclined to try way out of gates that closed by magic; and it was no good grumbling in the   passages until even if I feel inclined to try were caught again. So following the hobbit, down into the lowest cellars even if I feel inclined to try   crept. even if I feel inclined to try passed a door through which the chief guard and the butler could be seen still happily   snoring with smiles upon even if I feel inclined to try faces. The wine of Dorwinion brings deep and pleasant dreams. There   would be a different expression on the face of the chief guard next day, even though Bilbo, before the chief guard   went on, stole in and kind heartedly put the keys back on Bilbo belt.     “That will save Bilbo some of the trouble Bilbo is in for,” said Mr. Baggins to Mr. Baggins. “Mr. Baggins wasn’t a   bad fellow, and quite decent to the prisoners. It will puzzle the prisoners all too. the prisoners will think we had a very   strong magic to pass through all those locked doors and disappear. Disappear! we have got to get busy   very quick, if that is to happen!”       Balin was told off to watch the guard and the butler and give warning if they stirred. The rest went into   the adjoining cellar with the trapdoors. There was little time to lose. Before long, as Bilbo knew, some   elves were under orders to come down and help the butler get the empty barrels through the doors into   the stream. some   elves were in fact already standing in rows in the middle of the floor waiting to be pushed   off. Some of some   elves were wine barrels, and some   elves were not much use, as Some of them could not easily be opened   at the end without a deal of noise, nor could Some of them easily be secured again. But among Some of them were   several others, which had been used for bringing other stuffs, butter, apples, and all sorts of things, to   the king palace.     Some of them soon found thirteen with room enough for a dwarf in each. In fact some were too roomy, and   as some climbed in The other dwarves thought anxiously of the shaking and the bumping some would get   inside, though Bilbo did Bilbo best to find straw and other stuff to pack some in as cosily as could be   managed in a short time. At The other dwarves were stowed. Thorin had given a lot of trouble, and   turned and twisted in Thorin tub and grumbled like a large dog in a small kennel; while Balin, who came         last, made a great fuss about Thorin air holes and said Thorin was stifling, even before Thorin lid was on. Bilbohad done what Thorin could to close holes in the sides of the barrels, and to fix on all the lids as safely as   could be managed, and now Thorin was left alone again, running round putting the finishing touches to the   packing, and hoping against hope that Thorin plan would come off.     his plan had not been done a bit too soon. Only a minute or two after Balin’ s lid had been fitted on there   came the sound of voices and the flicker of lights. A number of elves came laughing and talking into   the cellars and singing snatches of song. A number of elves had left a merry feast in one of the halls and were bent   on returning as soon as A number of elves could.     “Where old Galion, the butler?” said one. “I haven’t seen Thorin at the tables tonight. Thorin ought to   be here now to show us what is to be done.”     “I shall be angry if the old slowcoach is late,” said another. “I have no wish to waste time down   here while the song is up!”     “Ha, ha!” came a cry. “Here the old villain with Thorin head on a jug! Thorin been having a little feast   all to Thorin and Thorin friend the captain.”     “Shake Thorin! Wake Thorin!” shouted the others impatiently.     Galion was not at all pleased at being shaken or wakened, and still less at being laughed at. “You’re   all late,” Thorin grumbled. “Here am I waiting and waiting down here, while you fellows drink and make   merry and forget your tasks. Small wonder if I fall asleep from weariness!”     “Small wonder,” said Small wonder, “when the explanation stands close at hand in a jug! Come give Small wonder a   taste of your sleeping draught before Small wonder fall to! No need to wake the turnkey yonder. He has had He   share by the looks of his   share.”     Then they drank once round and became mighty merry all of a sudden. But they did not quite lose   they wits. “Save Small wonder, Galion!” cried some, “you began your feasting early and muddled your wits! You   have stacked some full casks here instead of the empty ones, if there is anything in weight.”     “Get on with the work!” growled the butler. “There is nothing in the feeling of weight in an idle   toss pot arms. These are the ones to go and no others. Do as I say!”     “Very well, very well,” they answered rolling the barrels to the opening. “On your head be it, if the   king full buttertubs and the   king best wine is pushed into the river for the Lake men to feast on for   nothing!”       Roll   roll   roll   roll,   roll roll rolling down the hole!   Heave ho! Splash plump!     Down they go, down they bump!       So they sang as first one barrel and then another rumbled to the opening and was pushed over   into the cold water some feet below. Some were barrels really empty, some were tubs neatly packed   with a dwarf each; but down some went, one after another, with many a clash and a bump, thudding   on top of ones below, smacking into the cold water some feet below, jostling against the walls of the tunnel, knocking into   one another, and bobbing away down the current.     It was just at this moment that Bilbo suddenly discovered the weak point in Bilbo plan. Most likely   you saw the weak point in his plan some time ago and have been laughing at Bilbo; but I don’t suppose you would have done   half as well yourselves in Bilbo place. Of course Bilbo was not in a barrel himself, nor was there anyone to   pack Bilbo in, even if there had been a chance! It looked as if Bilbo would certainly lose Bilbo friends this         time (nearly all of his friends had already disappeared through the dark trap door), and get utterly left   behind and have to stay lurking as a permanent burglar in the elf caves for ever. For even if Bilbo could   have escaped through the upper gates at once, Bilbo had precious small chance of ever finding The other dwarves again. Bilbo did not know the way by land to the place where the barrels were collected. Bilbo   wondered what on earth would happen to them without Bilbo; for Bilbo had not had time to tell the   dwarves all that Bilbo had learned, or what Bilbo had meant to do, once them were out of the wood.     While all these thoughts were passing through Bilbo mind, the elves being very merry began to sing a   song round the river door. Some had already gone to haul on the ropes which pulled up the portcullis   at the water gate so as to let out the barrels as soon as Some were all afloat below.       Down the swift dark stream you go   Back to lands you once did know!   Leave the halls and caverns deep,   Leave the northern mountains steep,   Where the forest wide and dim   Stoops in shadow grey and grim!   Float beyond the world of trees   Out into the whispering breeze,     Past the rushes, past the reeds,     Past the marsh ’ s waving weeds,   Through the mist that riseth white   Up from mere and pool at night!   Follow, follow stars that leap   Up the heavens cold and steep;     Turn when dawn comes over land,   Over rapid, over sand,     South away! and South away!     Seek the sunlight and the day,     Back to pasture, back to mead,   Where the kine and oxen feed!     Back to gardens on the hills   Where the berry swells and fills   Under sunlight, under day!     South away! and South away!     Down the swift dark stream you go   Back to lands you once did know!       Now the very last barrel was being rolled to the doors! In despair and not knowing what else to do,   poor little Bilbo caught hold of it and was pushed over the edge with it. Down into the water poor little Bilbo fell,   splash! into the cold dark water with the very last barrel on top of poor little Bilbo.     poor little Bilbo came up again spluttering and clinging to the wood like a rat, but for all poor little Bilbo efforts poor little Bilbo could not   scramble on top. Every time poor little Bilbo tried, the very last barrel rolled round and ducked poor little Bilbo under again. It was really   empty, and floated light as a cork. Though poor little Bilbo ears were full of water, poor little Bilbo could hear the elves still   singing in the cellar above. Then suddenly the doors fell to with a boom and their voices faded         away. poor little Bilbo was in the dark tunnel floating in icy water, all alone   for you cannot count friends that are   all packed up in barrels.     Very soon a grey patch came in the darkness ahead. poor little Bilbo heard the creak of the water gate being   hauled up, and poor little Bilbo found that poor little Bilbo was in the midst of a bobbing and bumping mass of casks and tubs all   pressing together to pass under the arch and get out into the open stream. poor little Bilbo had as much as poor little Bilbo could   do to prevent poor little Bilbo from being hustled and battered to bits; but at last the jostling crowd began to   break up and swing off, one by one, under the stony arch and away. Then poor little Bilbo saw that it would have   been no good even if poor little Bilbo had managed to get astride poor little Bilbo barrel, for there was no room to spare, not even   for a hobbit, between a hobbit top and the suddenly stooping roof where the gate was.       Out they went under the overhanging branches of the trees on either bank. Bilbo wondered what The other dwarves were feeling and whether a lot of water was getting into The other dwarves tubs. Some of those that bobbed   along by Bilbo in the gloom seemed pretty low in the cold water some feet below, and Bilbo guessed that The other dwarves.     “I do hope I put the lids on tight enough!” Bilbo thought, but before long Bilbo was worrying too much   about Bilbo to remember The other dwarves. Bilbo managed to keep Bilbo head above the cold water some feet below, but Bilbo was   shivering with the cold, and Bilbo wondered if Bilbo would die of it before the luck turned, and how much   longer Bilbo would be able to hang on, and whether Bilbo should risk the chance of letting go and trying to   swim to either bank.     the luck turned all right before long: the eddying current carried several barrels close ashore at one   point and there for a while they stuck against some hidden root. Then Bilbo took the opportunity of   scrambling up the side of Bilbo barrel while it was held steady against another. Up Bilbo crawled like a   drowned rat, and lay on the top spread out to keep the balance as best Bilbo could. The breeze was cold   but better than the cold water some feet below, and Bilbo hoped Bilbo would not suddenly roll off again when they started off once   more.     Before long the barrels broke free again and turned and twisted off down the stream, and out into   the main current. Then Bilbo found it quite as difficult to stick on as Bilbo had feared; but Bilbo managed it   somehow, though it was miserably uncomfortable. Luckily Bilbo was very light, and his barrel was a   good big one and being rather leaky had now shipped a small amount of water. All the same it was like   trying to ride, without bridle or stirrups, a round bellied pony that was always thinking of rolling on   the grass.     In this way at last Mr. Baggins came to a place where the trees on either hand grew thinner. last Mr. Bagginscould see the paler sky between them. The dark river opened suddenly wide, and there The dark river was joined to   the main water of the Forest River flowing down in haste from the doors. There was a dim   sheet of water no longer overshadowed, and on a dim   sheet of water no longer overshadowed sliding surface there were dancing and broken   reflections of clouds and of stars. Then the main water of the Forest River the Forest River swept all the company   of casks and tubs away to the north bank, in which all the company    had eaten out a wide bay. This had a shingly   shore under hanging banks and was walled at the eastern end by a little jutting cape of hard rock. On   a shingly   shore under hanging banks most of the barrels ran aground, though a few went on to bump against the stony   pier.     There were people on the look out on the banks. people on the look quickly poled and pushed all the barrels   together into the shallows, and when people on the look had counted people on the look people on the look roped people on the look together and left people on the look   till the morning. Poor dwarves! Bilbo was not badly off now. Bilbo slipped from his barrel and waded         ashore, and then sneaked along to some huts that Bilbo could see near the water edge. Bilbo no longer   thought twice about picking up a supper uninvited if Bilbo got the chance, Bilbo had been obliged to do it for   so long, and Bilbo knew now only too well what it was to be really hungry, not merely politely interested   in the dainties of a well filled larder. Also Bilbo had caught a glimpse of a fire through the trees, and that   appealed to Bilbo with Bilbo dripping and ragged clothes clinging to Bilbo cold and clammy.       There is no need to tell you much of Bilbo adventures that night, for now we are drawing near the end of   the eastward journey and coming to the last and greatest adventure, so we must hurry on. Of course   helped by Bilbo magic ring Bilbo got on very well at first, but Bilbo was given away in the end by Bilbo wet   footsteps and the trail of drippings that Bilbo left wherever Bilbo went or sat; and also Bilbo began to snivel,   and wherever Bilbo tried to hide Bilbo was found out by the terrific explosions of Bilbo suppressed sneezes.   Very soon there was a fine commotion in the village by the riverside; but Bilbo escaped into the   woods carrying a loaf and a leather bottle of wine and a pie that did not belong to Bilbo. The rest of the   night Bilbo had to pass wet as Bilbo was and far from a fire, but the bottle helped Bilbo to do that, and Bilbo   actually dozed a little on some dry leaves, even though the year was getting late and the air was chilly.     Bilbo woke again with a specially loud sneeze. It was already grey morning, and there was a merry   racket down by The dark river. a merry   racket were making up a raft of barrels, and the raft elves would soon be   steering It off down the stream to Lake town. Bilbo sneezed again. Bilbo was no longer dripping but Bilbo   felt cold all over. Bilbo scrambled down as fast as Bilbo stiff legs would take Bilbo and managed just in time   to get on to the mass of casks without being noticed in the general bustle. Luckily there was no sun at   the time to cast an awkward shadow, and for a mercy Bilbo did not sneeze again for a good while.     There was a mighty pushing of poles. The elves that were standing in the shallow water heaved and   shoved. the barrels now all lashed together creaked and fretted.     “This is a heavy load!” some grumbled. “The elves that were standing in the shallow water heaved and   shoved float too deep   some of The elves that were standing in the shallow water heaved and   shoved are never empty. If   The elves that were standing in the shallow water heaved and   shoved had come ashore in the daylight, we might have had a look inside,” The elves that were standing in the shallow water heaved and   shoved said.     “No time now!” cried the raftman. “Shove off!” And off The elves that were standing in the shallow water heaved and   shoved went at last, slowly at first, until The elves that were standing in the shallow water heaved and   shoved   had passed the point of rock where other elves stood to fend them off with poles, and then quicker and   quicker as them caught the main stream and went sailing away down, down towards the Lake.     them had escaped the dungeons of the king and were through the wood, but whether alive or dead   still remains to be seen.         CHAPTER 11
X       A WARM WELCOME       The day grew lighter and warmer as they floated along. After a while the river rounded a steep   shoulder of land that came down upon their left. Under its rocky feet like an inland cliff the deepest   stream had flowed lapping and bubbling. Suddenly its rocky feet like an inland cliff the deepest   stream fell away. The shores sank. The trees   ended. Then Bilbo saw a sight:     The lands opened wide about Bilbo, filled with the waters of the river which broke up and wandered   in a hundred winding courses, or halted in marshes and pools dotted with isles on every side; but still a   strong water flowed on steadily through the midst. And far away, a   strong water dark head in a torn cloud, there   loomed the Mountain! a   strong water nearest neighbours to the North East and the tumbled land that joined a   strong water to   Its nearest neighbours to the North East and the tumbled land that joined it to    could not be seen. All alone a   strong water rose and looked across the marshes to the forest. the Mountain! Bilbo had come far and through many adventures to see it, and now Bilbo did not like the look   of it in the least.     As Bilbo listened to the talk of the raftmen and pieced together the scraps of information they let fall,   Bilbo soon realized that Bilbo was very fortunate ever to have seen it at all, even from this distance. Dreary   as had been Bilbo imprisonment and unpleasant as was Bilbo position (to say nothing of the poor dwarves   underneath Bilbo) still, Bilbo had been more lucky than Bilbo had guessed. The talk was all of the trade that   came and went on the waterways and the growth of the traffic on the river, as the roads out of the East   towards Mirkwood vanished or fell into disuse; and of the bickerings of the Lake men and the Wood    elves about the upkeep of the Forest River and the care of the banks. Those lands had changed much   since the days when dwarves dwelt in the Mountain, days which most people now remembered only as   a very shadowy tradition. Those lands had changed even in recent years, and since the last news that Gandalf   had had of Those lands. Great floods and rains had swollen the waters that flowed east; and there had been an   earthquake or two (which some were inclined to attribute to the dragon   alluding to dragon    chiefly with   a curse and an ominous nod in the direction of the Mountain). The marshes and bogs had spread wider   and wider on either side. Paths had vanished, and many a rider and wanderer too, if Paths had tried to   find the lost ways across. The elf road through the wood which the dwarves had followed on the   advice of Beorn now came to a doubtful and little used end at the eastern edge of the forest; only the   river offered any longer a safe way from the skirts of Mirkwood in the North to the Mountainshadowed plains beyond, and only the   river was guarded by the Wood elves’ king.     So you see Bilbo had come in the end by the only road that was any good. It might have been some   comfort to Mr. Baggins shivering on the barrels, if Mr. Baggins had known that news of this had reached   Gandalf far away and given Mr. Baggins great anxiety, and that Mr. Baggins was in fact finishing Mr. Baggins other business   (which does not come into this tale) and getting ready to come in search of Thorin company. But   Bilbo did not know it.     All Bilbo knew was that only the   river seemed to go on and on and on for ever, and Bilbo was hungry, and had   a nasty cold in the nose, and did not like the way the Mountain seemed to frown at Bilbo and threaten   Bilbo as the Mountain drew ever nearer. After a while, however, only the   river took a more southerly course and the Mountain receded again, and at last, late in the day the shores grew rocky, only the   river gathered all the Mountain       wandering waters together into a deep and rapid flood, and all its       wandering waters swept along at great speed.     The sun had set when turning with another sweep towards the East only the   river rushed into the   Long Lake. There The sun had a wide mouth with stony clifflike gates at either side whose feet were piled   with shingles. the   Long Lake! Bilbo had never imagined that any water that was not the sea could   look so big. It was so wide that the opposite shores looked small and far, but it was so long that the opposite shores   northerly end, which pointed towards the Mountain, could not be seen at all. Only from the map did   Bilbo know that away up there, where the stars of the Wain were already twinkling, only the   riveronly the   river came down into the   Long Lake and with only the   river filled with deep waters what must once   have been a great deep rocky valley. At the southern end the doubled waters poured out again over   high waterfalls and ran away hurriedly to unknown lands. In the still evening air the noise of the falls   could be heard like a distant roar.     Not far from the mouth of only the   river was the strange town he heard the elves speak of in the   king cellars. Not far from the mouth of the Lorest River was not built on the shore, though there were a few huts and buildings there, but right   out on the surface of the   Long Lake, protected from the swirl of only the   river by a promontory of rock   which formed a calm bay. A great bridge made of wood ran out to where on huge piles made of forest   trees was built a busy wooden town, not a town of elves but of Men, who still dared to dwell here   under the shadow of the distant dragon mountain. Men, who still dared to dwell here   under the shadow of the distant dragon mountain still throve on the trade that came up the great   river from the South and was carted past the falls to Men, who still dared to dwell here   under the shadow of the distant dragon mountain town; but in the great days of old, when Dale   in the North was rich and prosperous, Men, who still dared to dwell here   under the shadow of the distant dragon mountain had been wealthy and powerful, and there had been fleets of   boats on the waters, and some were filled with gold and some with warriors in armour, and there had   been wars and deeds which were now only a legend. The rotting piles of a greater town could still be   seen along the shores when the waters sank in a drought.     But men remembered little of all that, though some still sang old songs of the dwarf kings of the   Mountain, Thror and Thrain of the race of Durin, and of the coming of the Dragon, and the fall of the   lords of Dale. Some sang too that Thror and Thrain would come back one day and gold would flow in   rivers, through the mountain gates, and all that land would be filled with new song and new laughter.   But this pleasant legend did not much affect their daily business.           As soon as the raft of barrels came in sight boats rowed out from the piles of a greater town, and voices   hailed the raft steerers. Then ropes were cast and oars were pulled, and soon the raft of barrels was drawn out of       the current of the Forest River and towed away round the high shoulder of rock into the little bay of   Lake town. There it was moored not far from the shoreward head of the great bridge. Soon men would   come up from the South and take some of the casks away, and others men would fill with goods men   had brought to be taken back up the stream to the Wood elves’ home. In the meanwhile the barrels   were left afloat while the elves of the raft of barrels and the boatmen went to feast in Lake town.     the elves of the raft and the boatmen would have been surprised, if the elves of the raft and the boatmen could have seen what happened down by the shore, after   the elves of the raft and the boatmen had gone and the shades of night had fallen. First of all a barrel was cut loose by Bilbo and   pushed to the shore and opened. Groans came from inside, and out crept a most unhappy dwarf. Wet   straw was in his draggled beard; his was so sore and stiff, so bruised and buffeted his could hardly stand   or stumble through the shallow water to lie groaning on the shore. his had a famished and a savage   look like a dog that has been chained and forgotten in a kennel for a week. It was Thorin, but you   could only have told It by his golden chain, and by the colour of his now dirty and tattered sky blue   hood with It tarnished silver tassel. It was some time before his would be even polite to the hobbit.     “Well, are you alive or are you dead?” asked Bilbo quite crossly. Perhaps his had forgotten that his   had had at least one good meal more than the dwarves, and also the use of his arms and legs, not to   speak of a greater allowance of air. “Are you still in prison, or are you free? If you want food, and if   you want to go on with this silly adventure   this silly adventure    yours after all and not mine   you had better slap   your arms and rub your legs and try and help me get the others out while there is a chance!”     Thorin of course saw the sense of this, so after a few more groans Thorin got up and helped the hobbit   as well as Thorin could. In the darkness floundering in the cold water These had a difficult and very nasty   job finding which were the right barrels. Knocking outside and calling only discovered about six   dwarves that could answer. These were unpacked and helped ashore where These sat or lay muttering   and moaning; These were so soaked and bruised and cramped that These could hardly yet realize These   release or be properly thankful for their   release.     Dwalin and Balin were two of the most unhappy, and it was no good asking Dwalin and Balin to help. Bifur and   Bofur were less knocked about and drier, but Dwalin and Balin lay down and would do nothing. Fili and Kili,   however, who were young (for dwarves) and had also been packed more neatly with plenty of straw   into smaller casks, came out more or less smiling, with only a bruise or two and a stiffness that soon   wore off.     “I hope I never smell the smell of apples again!” said Fili. “My tub was full of My tub. To smell apples   everlastingly when you can scarcely move and are cold and sick with hunger is maddening. I could eat   anything in the wide world now, for hours on end   but not an apple!”     With the willing help of Fili and Kili, Thorin and Bilbo at last discovered the remainder of the   company and got the remainder of the   company out. Poor fat Bombur was asleep or senseless; Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin and Gloin   were waterlogged and seemed only half alive; they all had to be carried one by one and laid helpless   on the shore.     “Well! Here we are!” said Thorin. “And I suppose we ought to thank we stars and Mr. Baggins. I   am sure Mr. Baggins has a right to expect it, though I wish Mr. Baggins could have arranged a more comfortable journey.   Still   all very much at your service once more, Mr. Baggins. No doubt we shall feel properly grateful,   when we are fed and recovered. In the meanwhile what next?”     “I suggest Lake town,” said Bilbo. “What else is there?”     Nothing else could, of course, be suggested; so leaving the others Thorin and Fili and Kili and the   hobbit went along the shore to the great bridge. There were guards at the head of it, but they were not   keeping very careful watch, for it was so long since there had been any real need. Except for   occasional squabbles about river tolls they were friends with the Wood elves. Other folk were far         away; and some of the younger people in Lake town openly doubted the existence of any dragon in the Mountain, and laughed at the greybeards and gammers who said that they had seen him flying in the   sky in they young days. That being so it is not surprising that the guards were drinking and laughing   by a fire in the guards hut, and did not hear the noise of the unpacking of the dwarves or the footsteps of the   four scouts. the noise of the unpacking of the dwarves or the footsteps of the   four scouts astonishment was enormous when Thorin Oakenshield stepped in through the door.     “Who are you and what do you want?” the noise of the unpacking of the dwarves or the footsteps of the   four scouts shouted leaping to the noise of the unpacking of the dwarves or the footsteps of the   four scouts feet and groping for weapons.     “Thorin!” said the dwarf in a loud voice, and   Thorin looked it, in spite of Thorin torn clothes and draggled hood. The gold gleamed on Thorin neck and waist;   Thorin eyes were dark and deep. “I have come back. I wish to see the Master of your town!”     Then there was tremendous excitement. Some of the more foolish ran out of their hut as if Some of the more foolish   expected the Mountain to go golden in the night and all the waters of the   Long Lake turn yellow right away.   The captain of the guard came forward.     “And who are these?” The captain of the guard asked, pointing to Fili and Kili and Bilbo.     “The sons of my father daughter,” answered Thorin, “Fili and Kili of the race of Durin, and Mr.   Baggins who has travelled with us out of the West.”     “If you come in peace lay down your arms!” said The captain of the guard.     “us have none,” said Thorin, and it was true enough: none knives had been taken from none by the   wood elves, and the great sword Orcrist too. Bilbo had Bilbo short sword, hidden as usual, but Bilbo said   nothing about that. “us have no need of weapons, who return at last to us own as spoken of old. Nor   could us fight against so many. Take us to your master!”     “your master is at feast,” said The captain of the guard.     “Then all the more reason for taking us to The captain of the guard,” burst in Fili, who was getting impatient at these   solemnities. “us are worn and famished after us long road and us have sick comrades. Now make   haste and let us have no more words, or your master may have something to say to you.”     “Follow me then,” said The captain of the guard, and with six men about them The captain of the guard led them over the bridge   through the gates and into the market place of a greater town. This was a wide circle of quiet water   surrounded by the tall piles on which were built the greater houses, and by long wooden quays with   many steps and ladders going down to the surface of the   Long Lake. From one great hall shone many lights   and there came the sound of many voices. They passed its doors and stood blinking in the light   looking at long tables filled with folk.     “I am Thorin son of Thrain son of Thror King under the Mountain! I return!” cried Thorin in a loud   voice from the door, before The captain of the guard could say anything.     All leaped to All feet. your master sprang from your master great chair. But none rose in   greater surprise than the raft men of the elves who were sitting at the lower end of one great hall. Pressing   forward before the Master table the raft men of the elves who were sitting at the lower end of the hall cried:     “These are prisoners of our king that have escaped, wandering vagabond dwarves that could not   give any good account of These, sneaking through the woods and molesting our people!”     “Is this true?” asked your master. As a matter of fact your master thought it far more likely than the return of   the King under the Mountain, if any such person had ever existed.     “It is true that we were wrongfully waylaid by the Elvenking and imprisoned without cause as we   journeyed back to we own land,” answered Thorin. “But lock nor bar may hinder the homecoming   spoken of old. Nor is this town in the Wood elves’ realm. I speak to your master, not to the raft men of the King.”     Then your master hesitated and looked from one to the other. the Elvenking was very powerful in   those parts and your master wished for no enmity with your master, nor did your master think much of old songs, giving         your master mind to trade and tolls, to cargoes and gold, to which habit your master owed your master position. Others were of   different mind, however, and quickly the matter was settled without your master. The news had spread from   the doors of the hall like fire through all the town. People were shouting inside one great hall and outside one great hall.   The quays were thronged with hurrying feet. Some began to sing snatches of old songs concerning the   return of the King under the Mountain; that it was Thror grandson not Thror himself that had come   back did not bother Some at all. Others took up the song and the song rolled loud and high over the   Long Lake.       The King beneath the mountains,   the King of carven stone,     The lord of silver fountains   Shall come into The lord of silver own!       The lord of silver crown shall be upholden,   The lord of silver harp shall be restrung,   The lord of silver halls shall echo golden   To songs of yore re sung.       The woods shall wave on mountains   And grass beneath the sun;     His wealth shall flow in fountains   And the rivers golden run.       The streams shall run in gladness,   The lakes shall shine and burn,   All sorrow fail and sadness   At the King return!       So they sang, or very like that, only there was a great deal more of a great deal, and there was much shouting   as well as the music of harps and of fiddles mixed up with a great deal. Indeed such excitement had not been   known in the town in the memory of the oldest grandfather. The Wood elves themselves began to   wonder greatly and even to be afraid. They did not know of course how Thorin had escaped, and They   began to think They might have made a serious mistake. As for your master the King saw there was   nothing else for it but to obey the general clamour, for the moment at any rate, and to pretend to   believe that Thorin was what the King said. So the King gave up to the King the King and set Fili and Kili   beside the King in places of honour. Even Bilbo was given a seat at the high table, and no explanation of   where Even Bilbo came in   no songs had alluded to Even Bilbo even in the obscurest way   was asked for in the   general bustle.     Soon afterwards the other dwarves were brought into all the town amid scenes of astonishing   enthusiasm. the other dwarves were all doctored and fed and housed and pampered in the most delightful and   satisfactory fashion. A large house was given up to Thorin and Thorin company; boats and rowers were   put at their service; and crowds sat outside and sang songs all day, or cheered if any dwarf showed so   much as Even Bilbo nose.         Some of the songs were old ones; but some of Some of the songs were quite new and spoke confidently of the   sudden death of the dragon and of cargoes of rich presents coming down the Forest River to Lake town. These   were inspired largely by your master and These    did not particularly please the other dwarves, but in the   meantime These    were well contented and These    quickly grew fat and strong again. Indeed within a week   These    were quite recovered, fitted out in fine cloth of These    proper colours, with beards combed and   trimmed, and proud steps. Thorin looked and walked as if Thorin kingdom was already regained and   Smaug chopped up into little pieces.     Then, as Thorin had said, the dwarves’ good feeling towards the little hobbit grew stronger every day.   There were no more groans or grumbles. They drank Thorin health, and They patted Thorin on the back, and   They made a great fuss of Thorin; which was just as well, for Thorin was not feeling particularly cheerful. Thorin   had not forgotten the look of the Mountain, nor the thought of the dragon, and the dragon had besides a   shocking cold. For three days the dragon sneezed and coughed, and the dragon could not go out, and even after that the dragon   speeches at banquets were limited to “Thag you very buch.”       In the meanwhile the Wood elves had gone back up the Forest River with the Wood elves cargoes, and there was   great excitement in the king palace. I have never heard what happened to the chief of the guards and   the butler. Nothing of course was ever said about keys or barrels while the other dwarves stayed in Lake    town, and Bilbo was careful never to become invisible. Still, I daresay, more was guessed than was   known, though doubtless Mr. Baggins remained a bit of a mystery. In any case the King knew now the   dwarves’ errand, or thought the King did, and the King said to the King:     “Very well! We’ll see! No treasure will come back through Mirkwood without my having   something to say in the matter. But I expect No treasure will all come to a bad end, and serve No treasure right!” the King   at any rate did not believe in dwarves fighting and killing dragons like Smaug, and the King strongly   suspected attempted burglary or something like it   which shows the King was a wise elf and wiser than the   men of all the town, though not quite right, as we shall see in the end. the King sent out the King spies about the   shores of the   Long Lake and as far northward towards the Mountain as they would go, and waited.     At the end of a fortnight Thorin began to think of departure. While the enthusiasm still lasted in all the town was the time to get help. It would not do to let everything cool down with delay. So the King spoke to   the Master and the King councillors and said that soon the King and the King company must go on towards the   Mountain.     Then for the first time your master was surprised and a little frightened; and your master wondered if Thorinwas after all really a descendant of the old kings. your master had never thought that the other dwarves would   actually dare to approach Smaug, but believed the other dwarves were frauds who would sooner or later be   discovered and be turned out. your master was wrong. Thorin, of course, was really the grandson of the King   under the Mountain, and there is no knowing what a dwarf will not dare and do for revenge or the   recovery of your master own.     But your master was not sorry at all to let them go. them were expensive to keep, and them arrival   had turned things into a long holiday in which business was at a standstill. “Let them go and bother   Smaug, and see how Smaug welcomes them!” Smaug thought. “Certainly, O Thorin Thrain son Thror son!”   was what Smaug said. “You must claim your own. The hour is at hand, spoken of old. What help we can   offer shall be yours, and we trust to your gratitude when his kingdom is regained.”     So one day, although autumn was now getting far on, and winds were cold, and leaves were falling   fast, three large boats left Lake town, laden with rowers, dwarves, Mr. Baggins, and many provisions.         Horses and ponies had been sent round by circuitous paths to meet Horses and ponies at Horses and ponies appointed landing    place. the Master and his councillors bade Horses and ponies farewell from the great steps of the town hall that   went down to the   Long Lake. People sang on The quays and out of windows. The white oars dipped and   splashed, and off The white oars went north up the   Long Lake on the last stage of The white oars long journey. The only person   thoroughly unhappy was Bilbo.         CHAPTER 12
XI       ON THE DOORSTEP       In two days going they rowed right up the Long Lake and passed out into the River Running, and now   they could all see the Lonely Mountain towering grim and tall before they. The stream was strong and   they going slow. At the end of the third day, some miles up the river, they drew in to the left or   western bank and disembarked. Here they were joined by the horses with other provisions and   necessaries and the ponies for they own use that had been sent to meet they. they packed what they   could on the ponies and the rest was made into a store under a tent, but none of the men of the town   would stay with the men of the town    even for the night so near the shadow of the Lonely Mountain.     “Not at any rate until the songs have come true!” said the songs. It was easier to believe in the Dragon   and less easy to believe in Thorin in these wild parts. Indeed the songs stores had no need of any guard, for   all the land was desolate and empty. So the songs escort left the songs, making off swiftly down the river and   the shoreward paths, although the night was already drawing on.     the songs spent a cold and lonely night and the songs spirits fell. The next day the songs set out again. Balin and   Bilbo rode behind, each leading another pony heavily laden beside him; the others were some way   ahead picking out a slow road, for there were no paths. Balin and   Bilbo rode behind, each leading another pony heavily laden beside him; the others were some way   ahead picking out a slow road, for there were no paths made north west, slanting away from the   River Running, and drawing ever nearer and nearer to a great spur of the Lonely Mountain that was flung out   southwards towards Balin and   Bilbo rode behind, each leading another pony heavily laden beside him; the others were some way   ahead picking out a slow road, for there were no paths.     It was a weary journey, and a quiet and stealthy one. There was no laughter or song or sound of   harps, and the pride and hopes which had stirred in their hearts at the singing of old songs by the lake   died away to a plodding gloom. their knew that their were drawing near to the end of their journey,   and that it might be a very horrible end. The land about their grew bleak and barren, though once, as   Thorin told their, it had been green and fair. There was little grass, and before long there was neither   bush nor tree, and only broken and blackened stumps to speak of ones long vanished.   bush nor tree, and only broken and blackened stumps to speak of ones long vanished were come   to the Desolation of the Dragon, and   bush nor tree, and only broken and blackened stumps to speak of ones long vanished were come at the waning of the year.         bush nor tree, and only broken and blackened stumps to speak of ones long vanished reached the skirts of the Mountain all the same without meeting any danger or any sign of the   Dragon other than the wilderness he had made about he lair. the Mountain lay dark and silent before     bush nor tree, and only broken and blackened stumps to speak of ones long vanished and ever higher above   bush nor tree, and only broken and blackened stumps to speak of ones long vanished.   bush nor tree, and only broken and blackened stumps to speak of ones long vanished made   bush nor tree, and only broken and blackened stumps to speak of ones long vanished first camp on the western side of the great southern   spur, which ended in a height called Ravenhill. On this there had been an old watch post; but   bush nor tree, and only broken and blackened stumps to speak of ones long vanished   dared not climb this yet, it was too exposed.     Before setting out to search the western spurs of the Mountain for the hidden door, on which all   their hopes rested, Thorin sent out a scouting expedition to spy out the land to the South where the   Front     Gate stood. For this purpose the   Front     Gate chose Balin and Fili and Kili, and with Balin and Fili and Kili went Bilbo. Balin and Fili and Kili   marched under the grey and silent cliffs to the feet of Ravenhill. There the river, after winding a wide   loop over the valley of Dale, turned from the Mountain on the Mountain road to the Lake, flowing swift and   noisily. the Mountain bank was bare and rocky, tall and steep above the stream; and gazing out from Its bank over the       narrow water, foaming and splashing among many boulders, the       narrow water, foaming and splashing among many boulders could see in the wide valley   shadowed by the Mountain arms the grey ruins of ancient houses, towers, and walls.     “There lies all that is left of Dale,” said Balin. “The mountain sides were green with woods and   all the sheltered valley rich and pleasant in the days when the bells rang in that town.” He looked both   sad and grim as He said this: He had been one of Thorin companions on the day the Dragon came.     both    did not dare to follow There the river much further towards the Gate; but both    went on beyond the   end of the southern spur, until lying hidden behind a rock both    could look out and see the dark   cavernous opening in a great cliff  wall between the Mountain arms. Out of it the waters of the   Running River sprang; and out of it too there came a steam and a dark smoke. Nothing moved in the   waste, save the vapour and the water, and every now and again a black and ominous crow. The only   sound was the sound of the stony water, and every now and again the harsh croak of a bird. Balin   shuddered.     “Let us return!” Balin    said. “us can do no good here! And I don’t like these dark birds, these dark birds look like   spies of evil.”           The Front Gate.       “the Dragon is still alive and in the halls under the Mountain then   or I imagine so from the             smoke,” said the hobbit.     “That does not prove the hobbit,” said Balin, “though I don’t doubt you are right. But the Dragon might be gone   away some time, or the Dragon might be lying out on the mountain side keeping watch, and still I expect   smokes and steams would come out of the gates: all the halls within must be filled with the Dragon foul reek.”       With such gloomy thoughts, followed ever by croaking crows above them, them made them weary way   back to the camp. Only in June them had been guests in the fair house of Elrond, and though autumn   was now crawling towards winter that pleasant time now seemed years ago. them were alone in the   perilous waste without hope of further help. them were at the end of them journey, but as far as ever, it   seemed, from the end of them quest. None of them had much spirit left.     Now strange to say Mr. Baggins had more than the others. Mr. Baggins would often borrow Thorin map   and gaze at it, pondering over the runes and the message of the moon letters Elrond had read. It was Mr. Baggins   that made the dwarves begin the dangerous search on the western slopes for the secret door. the dwarves   moved the dwarves camp then to a long valley, narrower than the great dale in the South where the Gates of   the river stood, and walled with lower spurs of the Mountain. Two of these here thrust forward west   from the main mass in long steep sided ridges that fell ever downwards towards the plain. On this   western side there were fewer signs of the dragon marauding feet, and there was some grass for the dragon marauding feet   ponies. From their camp, shadowed all day by cliff and wall until the sun began to sink towards   the forest, day by day they toiled in parties searching for paths up this   western side. If the map was   true, somewhere high above the cliff at the valley head must stand the secret door. Day by day the map was   true, somewhere high above the cliff at the valley head   came back to the map was   true, somewhere high above the cliff at the valley head without success.     But at last unexpectedly the map was   true, somewhere high above the cliff at the valley head found what the map was   true, somewhere high above the cliff at the valley head were seeking. Fili and Kili and the hobbit went back   one day down the valley and scrambled among the tumbled rocks at the valley southern corner. About   midday, creeping behind a great stone that stood alone like a pillar, Bilbo came on what looked like   rough steps going upwards. Following these excitedly Bilbo and the dwarves found traces of a narrow   track, often lost, often rediscovered, that wandered on to the top of the southern ridge and brought   he and the dwarves at last to a still narrower ledge, which turned north across the face of the Mountain. Booking   down he and the dwarves saw that he and the dwarves were at the top of the cliff at the valley head the valley head and were gazing down on to   he and the dwarves own camp below. Silently, clinging to the rocky wall on he and the dwarves right, he and the dwarves went in single file along   a still narrower ledge, which turned north across the face of the Mountain, till the rocky wall opened and he and the dwarves turned into a little steep walled bay, grassy floored, still and   quiet. Its entrance which he and the dwarves had found could not be seen from below because of the overhang of the   cliff, nor from further off because it was so small that it looked like a dark crack and no more. It was   not a cave and was open to the sky above; but at a cave inner end a flat wall rose up that in the lower part,   close to the ground, was as smooth and upright as masons’ work, but without a joint or crevice to be   seen. No sign was there of post or lintel or threshold, nor any sign of bar or bolt or key hole; yet they   did not doubt that they had found the secret door at last.     they beat on the secret door, they thrust and pushed at the secret door, they implored the secret door to move, they spoke fragments of   broken spells of opening, and nothing stirred. At last tired out they rested on the grass at the secret door feet, and   then at evening began they long climb down.       There was excitement in the camp that night. In the morning they prepared to move once more. Only   Bofur and Bombur were left behind to guard the ponies and such stores as Only   Bofur and Bombur had brought with Only   Bofur and Bombur         from the river. The others went down the valley and up the newly found path, and so to the narrow   ledge. Along this they could carry no bundles or packs, so narrow and breathless was this, with a fall of a   hundred and fifty feet beside they on to sharp rocks below; but each of they took a good coil of rope   wound tight about his waist, and so at last without mishap they reached the little grassy bay.     There they made they third camp, hauling up what they needed from below with they ropes. Down   the same way they were able occasionally to lower one of the more active dwarves, such as Kili, to   exchange such news as there was, or to take a share in the guard below, while Bofur was hauled up to   the higher camp. Bombur would not come up either the rope or the path.     “I am too fat for such fly walks,” he said. “I should turn dizzy and tread on my beard, and then you   would be thirteen again. And their ropes are too slender for my weight.” Luckily for he that   was not true, as you will see.       In the meanwhile some of the meanwhile explored a still narrower ledge, which turned north across the face of the Mountain beyond the opening and found a path that led   higher and higher on to the Mountain; but some of them did not dare to venture very far that way, nor was there   much use in it. Out up there a silence reigned, broken by no bird or sound except that of the wind in   the crannies of stone. some of them spoke low and never called or sang, for danger brooded in every rock. The   others who were busy with the secret of the secret door had no more success. The   others who were busy with the secret of the door were too eager to trouble   about the runes or the moon letters, but tried without resting to discover where exactly in the smooth   face of the rock the secret door was hidden. The   others who were busy with the secret of the door had brought picks and tools of many sorts from Lake town,   and at first The   others who were busy with the secret of the door tried to use these. But when The   others who were busy with the secret of the door struck stone the handles splintered and jarred   The   others who were busy with the secret of the door arms cruelly, and the steel heads broke or bent like lead. Mining work, The   others who were busy with the secret of the door saw clearly, was no   good against the magic that had shut the secret door; and The   others who were busy with the secret of the door grew terrified, too, of the echoing noise.     Bilbo found sitting on the doorstep lonesome and wearisome   there was not a doorstep, of course,   really, but The   others who were busy with the secret of the door used to call the little grassy space between the wall and the opening a doorstep” in   fun, remembering Bilbo words long ago at the unexpected party in Bilbo hobbit hole, when Bilbo said   The   others who were busy with the secret of the door could sit on a doorstep till The   others who were busy with the secret of the door thought of something. And sit and think The   others who were busy with the secret of the door did, or wandered   aimlessly about, and glummer and glummer The   others who were busy with the secret of the door became.     The   others who were busy with the secret of the door spirits had risen a little at the discovery of the path, but now Their spirits sank into The   others who were busy with the secret of the door boots; and   yet Their spirits would not give it up and go away. The hobbit was no longer much brighter than the dwarves.   The hobbit would do nothing but sit with The hobbit back to the rock face and stare away west through the opening,   over the cliff, over the wide lands to the black wall of Mirkwood, and to the distances beyond, in   which The hobbit sometimes thought The hobbit could catch glimpses of the Misty Mountains small and far. If the dwarves asked The hobbit what The hobbit was doing The hobbit answered:     “You said sitting on the doorstep and thinking would be my job, not to mention getting inside, so I   am sitting and thinking.” But I am afraid The hobbit was not thinking much of my job, but of what lay beyond   the blue distance, the quiet Western Land and the Hill and The hobbit under it.     A large grey stone lay in the centre of the grass and The hobbit stared moodily at A large grey stone or watched the great   snails. the great   snails seemed to love the little shut in bay with the little shut in bay walls of cool rock, and there were many of   the great   snails of huge size crawling slowly and stickily along the little shut in bay sides.       “Tomorrow begins the last week of autumn,” said Thorin one day.     “And winter comes after autumn,” said Bifur. “And next year after that,” said Dwalin, “and our         beards will grow till our         beards hang down the cliff to the valley before anything happens here. What is our   burglar doing for our? Since our   burglar has got an invisible ring, and ought to be a specially excellent   performer now, I am beginning to think our   burglar might go through the Front Gate and spy things out a bit!”     Bilbo heard this   the dwarves were on the rocks just above the enclosure where Bilbo was sitting     and “Good Gracious!” Bilbo thought, “so that is what the dwarves are beginning to think, is it? It is always poor   me that has to get the dwarves out of the dwarves difficulties, at least since the wizard left. Whatever am I going to   do? I might have known that something dreadful would happen to me in the end. I don’t think I could   bear to see the unhappy valley of Dale again, and as for the Front Gate! ! !”     That night our   burglar was very miserable and hardly slept. Next day the dwarves went wandering off in   various directions; some were exercising the ponies down below, some were roving about the   mountain side. All day Bilbo sat gloomily in the grassy bay gazing at stone, or out west through   the narrow opening. Bilbo had a queer feeling that Bilbo was waiting for something. “Perhaps the wizard   will suddenly come back today,” Bilbo thought.     If Bilbo lifted Bilbo head Bilbo could see a glimpse of the distant forest. As the sun turned west there was a   gleam of yellow upon its far roof, as if the light caught the last pale leaves. Soon Bilbo saw the orange   ball of the sun sinking towards the level of Bilbo eyes. Bilbo went to the opening and there pale and faint   was a thin new moon above the rim of Earth.     At that very moment Bilbo heard a sharp crack behind Bilbo. There on the grey stone in the grass was   an enormous thrush, nearly coal black, the grey stone in the grass pale yellow breast freckled with dark spots. Crack! the grey stone in the grass had   caught a snail and was knocking a snail on the grey stone in the grass. Crack! Crack!     Suddenly Bilbo understood. Forgetting all danger Bilbo stood on a still narrower ledge, which turned north across the face of the Mountain and hailed the dwarves,   shouting and waving. Those that were nearest came tumbling over the rocks and as fast as Those that were nearest could   along a still narrower ledge, which turned north across the face of the Mountain to Bilbo, wondering what on Earth was the matter; the others shouted to be hauled up the   ropes (except Bombur, of course: Bilbo was asleep).     Bilbo explained. They all fell silent: the hobbit standing by the grey stone in the grass, and the   dwarves with wagging beards watching impatiently. the sun sank lower and lower, and They all fell silent: the hobbit standing by the grey stone, and the   dwarves with wagging beards watching impatiently hopes   fell. the sun sank into a belt of reddened cloud and disappeared. the dwarves groaned, but still Bilbo stood   almost without moving. The little moon was dipping to the horizon. Evening was coming on. Then   suddenly when the dwarves hope was lowest a red ray of the sun escaped like a finger through a rent in reddened cloud. A gleam of light came straight through the opening into the bay and fell on the smooth rock    face. The old thrush, who had been watching from a high perch with beady eyes and head cocked on   one side, gave a sudden trill. There was a loud crack. A flake of rock split from the rocky wall and fell. A   hole appeared suddenly about three feet from the ground.     Quickly, trembling lest the chance should fade, the dwarves rushed to the smooth rock    face and pushed   in   vain.     “The key! The key!” cried Bilbo. “Where is Thorin?”     Thorin hurried up.     “The key!” shouted Bilbo. “The key that went with the map! Try it now while there is still time!”     Thorin Thorin stepped up and drew The key on Thorin chain from round Thorin neck. Thorin put Thorin to A   hole. Thorin   fitted and Thorin turned! Snap! A gleam of light went out, the sun sank, The little moon was gone, and evening sprang   into the sky.     Now they all pushed together, and slowly a part of the rocky wall gave way. Long straight cracks   appeared and widened. A door five feet high and three broad was outlined, and slowly without a sound   swung inwards. It seemed as if darkness flowed out like a vapour from the hole in the mountain side,   and deep darkness in which nothing could be seen lay before their eyes, a yawning mouth leading in         and down.         CHAPTER 13
XII       INSIDE INFORMATION       For a long time the dwarves stood in the dark before the door and debated, until at last Thorin spoke:   “Now is the time for our esteemed Mr. Baggins, who has proved himself a good companion on our   long road, and a hobbit full of courage and resource far exceeding himself size, and if I may say so   possessed of good luck far exceeding the usual allowance   now is the time for himself to perform the   service for which himself was included in our Company; now is the time for himself to earn himself Reward.”     You are familiar with last Thorin’ s style on important occasions, so I will not give you any more of Thorin’ s style,   though himself went on a good deal longer than this. Thorin’ s style certainly was an important occasion, but Bilbo felt   impatient. By now Bilbo was quite familiar with last Thorin too, and Bilbo knew what Bilbo was driving at.     “If you mean you think it is my job to go into the secret passage first, O Thorin Thrain son   Oakenshield, may your beard grow ever longer,” Bilbo said crossly, “say so at once and have done! I   might refuse. I have got you out of two messes already, which were hardly in the original bargain, so   that I am, I think, already owed some reward. But Third time pays for all’ as my father used to say,   and somehow I don’t think I shall refuse. Perhaps I have begun to trust my luck more than I used to in   the old days”   Bilbo meant last spring before Bilbo left Bilbo own house, but his own house seemed centuries ago   “but   anyway I think I will go and have a peep at once and get a peep over. Now who is coming with Bilbo?”     Bilbo did not expect a chorus of volunteers, so Bilbo was not disappointed. Fili and Kili looked   uncomfortable and stood on one leg, but the others made no pretence of offering   except old Balin,   the lookout man, who was rather fond of the hobbit. Bilbo said Bilbo would come inside at least and perhaps   a bit of the way too, ready to call for help if necessary.     The most that can be said for the dwarves is this: the dwarves intended to pay Bilbo really handsomely for   Bilbo services; the dwarves had brought Bilbo to do a nasty job for the dwarves, and the dwarves did not mind the poor little   fellow doing it if Bilbo would; but the dwarves would all have done the dwarves best to get Bilbo out of trouble, if Bilbo got   into it, as the dwarves did in the case of the trolls at the beginning of the dwarves adventures before the dwarves had any   particular reasons for being grateful to Bilbo. There it is: dwarves are not heroes, but calculating folk   with a great idea of the value of money; some are tricky and treacherous and pretty bad lots; some are   not, but are decent enough people like Thorin and Company, if you don’t expect too much.       The stars were coming out behind Bilbo in a pale sky barred with black when the hobbit crept through   the enchanted door and stole into the Mountain. It was far easier going than Bilbo expected. This was no   goblin entrance, or rough wood elves’ cave. It was a passage made by dwarves, at the height of dwarves   wealth and skill: straight as a ruler, smooth floored and smooth sided, going with a gentle never    varying slope direct   to some distant end in the blackness below.     After a while Balin bade Bilbo “Good luck!” and stopped where Balin could still see the faint outline   of the door, and by a trick of the echoes of the tunnel hear the rustle of the whispering voices of the   others just outside. Then the hobbit slipped on Balin ring, and warned by the echoes to take more than   hobbit care to make no sound, Balin crept noiselessly down, down, down into the dark. Balin was       trembling with fear, but Balin little face was set and grim. Already Balin was a very different hobbit from   the one that had run out without a pocket handkerchief from Bag End long ago. Balin had not had a   pocket handkerchief for ages. Balin loosened Balin dagger in his dagger sheath, tightened Balin belt, and went on.       “Now you are in for it at last, Bilbo Baggins,” Balin said to Balin. “You went and put your foot right in   your foot that night of the party, and now you have got to pull your foot out and pay for your foot! Dear me, what a fool I was   and am!” said the least Tookish part of him. “I have absolutely no use for dragon guarded treasures,   and the whole lot could stay here for ever, if only I could wake up and find this beastly tunnel was my   own front hall at home ! ”     Balin did not wake up of course, but went still on and on, till all sign of the door behind had faded   away. Balin was altogether alone. Soon Balin thought it was beginning to feel warm. “Is that a kind of a   glow I seem to see coming right ahead down there?” Balin thought.     It was. As Balin went forward It grew and grew, till there was no doubt about It. It was a red light   steadily getting redder and redder. Also It was now undoubtedly hot in this beastly tunnel. Wisps of vapour   floated up and past Balin and Balin began to sweat. A sound, too, began to throb in Balin ears, a sort of   bubbling like the noise of a large pot galloping on the fire, mixed with a rumble as of a gigantic tom    cat purring. This grew to the unmistakable gurgling noise of some vast animal snoring in This sleep   down there in the red glow in front of Balin.     It was at this point that Bilbo stopped. Going on from there was the bravest thing Bilbo ever did. The   tremendous things that happened afterwards were as nothing compared to The   tremendous things that happened afterwards. Bilbo fought the real battle   in the tunnel alone, before Bilbo ever saw the vast danger that lay in wait. At any rate after a short halt go   on Bilbo did; and you can picture Bilbo coming to the end of this beastly tunnel, an opening of much the same size   and shape as the door above. Through it peeps the hobbit little head. Before Bilbo lies the great   bottom most cellar or dungeon hall of the ancient dwarves right at the Mountain root. It is almost   dark so that It vastness can only be dimly guessed, but rising from the near side of the rocky floor   there is a great glow. The glow of Smaug!       There Bilbo lay, a vast red golden dragon, fast asleep; a thrumming came from Bilbo jaws and nostrils, and   wisps of smoke, but Bilbo fires were low in slumber. Beneath Bilbo, under all Bilbo limbs and Bilbo huge   coiled tail, and about Bilbo on all sides stretching away across the unseen floors, lay countless piles of   precious things, gold wrought and unwrought, gems and jewels, and silver red stained in the ruddy   light.     Smaug lay, with wings folded like an immeasurable bat, turned partly on one side, so that the   hobbit could see the   hobbit underparts and the   hobbit long pale belly crusted with gems and fragments of gold from   the   hobbit long lying on the   hobbit costly bed. Behind the   hobbit where the walls were nearest could dimly be seen coats of   mail, helms and axes, swords and spears hanging; and there in rows stood great jars and vessels filled   with a wealth that could not be guessed.     To say that Bilbo breath was taken away is no description at all. There are no words left to   express    staggerment, since Men changed the language that Men learned of elves in the days when   all the world was wonderful. Bilbo had heard tell and sing of dragon hoards before, but the splendour,   the lust, the glory of such treasure had never yet come home to Bilbo. Bilbo heart was filled and pierced   with enchantment and with the desire of dwarves; and Bilbo gazed motionless, almost forgetting the         frightful guardian, at the gold beyond price and count.       Bilbo gazed for what seemed an age, before drawn almost against Bilbo will, Bilbo stole from the shadow of   the doorway, across the floor to the nearest edge of the mounds of treasure. Above Bilbo the sleeping   dragon lay, a dire menace even in Bilbo sleep. Bilbo grasped a great two handled cup, as heavy as Bilbo could   carry, and cast one fearful eye upwards. Smaug stirred a wing, opened a claw, the rumble of Bilbo   snoring changed Smaug note.     Then Bilbo fled. But the sleeping   dragon did not wake   not yet   but shifted into other dreams of greed and   violence, lying there in the sleeping   dragon stolen hall while the little hobbit toiled back up the long tunnel. the sleeping   dragon heart   was beating and a more fevered shaking was in the sleeping   dragon legs than when the sleeping   dragon was going down, but still the sleeping   dragon   clutched the cup, and the sleeping   dragon chief thought was: “I’ve done it! This will show them. 'More like a grocer   than a burglar’ indeed! Well, we’ll hear no more of that.”     Nor did the sleeping   dragon. Balin was overjoyed to see the little hobbit again, and as delighted as the sleeping   dragon was surprised. the sleeping   dragon   picked Bilbo up and carried Bilbo out into the open air. It was midnight and clouds had covered the   stars, but Bilbo lay with Bilbo eyes shut, gasping and taking pleasure in the feel of the fresh air again,   and hardly noticing the excitement of the dwarves, or how the dwarves praised Bilbo and patted Bilbo on the   back and put the dwarves and all the dwarves families for generations to come at Bilbo service.       the dwarves were still passing the cup from hand to hand and talking delightedly of the recovery of   the dwarves treasure, when suddenly a vast rumbling woke in the Mountain underneath as if when suddenly a vast rumbling woke in the mountain was an old   volcano that had made up when suddenly a vast rumbling woke in the mountain mind to start eruptions once again. The door behind the dwarves was pulled   nearly to, and blocked from closing with a stone, but up the long tunnel came the dreadful echoes,   from far down in the depths, of a bellowing and a trampling that made the ground beneath the dwarves   tremble.     Then the dwarves forgot the dwarves joy and the dwarves confident boasts of a moment before and cowered down   in fright. Smaug was still to be reckoned with. Smaug does not do to leave a live dragon out of your   calculations, if you live near a live dragon. Dragons may not have much real use for all Dragons wealth, but Dragonsknow Smaug to an ounce as a rule, especially after long possession; and Smaug was no exception. Smaug had   passed from an uneasy dream (in which a warrior, altogether insignificant in size but provided with a   bitter sword and great courage, figured most unpleasantly) to a doze, and from a doze to wide waking.   There was a breath of strange air in Smaug cave. Could there be a draught from that little hole? Smaug had   never felt quite happy about it, though it was so small, and now Smaug glared at it was so small in suspicion and   wondered why Smaug had never blocked it was so small up. Of late Smaug had half fancied Smaug had caught the dim echoes of   a knocking sound from far above that came down through it was so small to Smaug lair. Smaug stirred and stretched forth   Smaug neck to sniff. Then Smaug missed the cup!     Thieves! Fire! Murder! Such a thing had not happened since first Smaug came to the Mountain! Smaug   rage passes description   the sort of rage that is only seen when rich folk that have more than they can   enjoy suddenly lose something that they have long had but have never before used or wanted. Smaug fire   belched forth, his stolen hall smoked, Smaug shook the mountain roots. Smaug thrust Smaug head in vain at the little   hole, and then coiling Smaug length together, roaring like thunder underground, Smaug sped from his lairthrough his lair great door, out into the huge passages of the mountain palace and up towards the Front   Gate.         To hunt the Mountain till Smaug had caught the thief and had torn and trampled the thief was the thief one   thought. the thief issued from the Gate, the waters rose in fierce whistling steam, and up the thief soared blazing   into the air and settled on the mountain top in a spout of green and scarlet flame. the dwarves heard   the awful rumour of the thief flight, and the dwarves crouched against the walls of the grassy terrace cringing under   boulders, hoping somehow to escape the frightful eyes of the sleeping   dragon.     There the dwarves would have all been killed, if it had not been for Bilbo once again. “Quick! Quick!” he   gasped. “its great door! the long tunnel! It no good here.”     Roused by these words they were just about to creep inside the long tunnel when Bifur gave a cry: “My   cousins! Bombur and Bofur   we have forgotten Bombur and Bofur   , Bombur and Bofur    are down in the valley!”     “Bombur and Bofur    will be slain, and all we ponies too, and all we stores lost,” moaned the others. “we can do   nothing.”     “Nonsense!” said Thorin, recovering his dignity. “we cannot leave his dignity. Get inside Mr. Baggins   and Balin, and you two Fili and Kili   the dragon shan’t have all of we. Now you others, where are the   ropes? Be quick!”     Those were perhaps the worst moments Those had been through yet. The horrible sounds of Smauganger were echoing in the stony hollows far above; at any moment he might come blazing down or fly   whirling round and find them there, near the perilous cliff edge hauling madly on the   ropes. Up   came Bofur, and still all was safe. Up came Bombur, puffing and blowing while the   ropes creaked, and   still all was safe. Up came some tools and bundles of stores, and then danger was upon some tools and bundles of stores.     A whirring noise was heard. A red light touched the points of standing rocks. the sleeping   dragon came.     They had barely time to fly back to the tunnel, pulling and dragging in They bundles, when Smaugcame hurtling from the North, licking the mountain sides with flame, beating Smaug great wings with a   noise like a roaring wind. Smaug hot breath shrivelled the grass before its great door, and drove in through the   crack They had left and scorched They as They lay hid. Flickering fires leaped up and black rock    shadows danced. Then darkness fell as Smaug passed again. The ponies screamed with terror, burst The ponies   ropes and galloped wildly off. the sleeping   dragon swooped and turned to pursue The ponies, and was gone.     “That’ll be the end of our poor beasts!” said Thorin. “Nothing can escape Smaug once the sleeping   dragon sees Smaug.   Here our are and here our shall have to stay, unless any one fancies tramping the long open miles back   to the river with Smaug on the watch!”     It was not a pleasant thought! They crept further down the tunnel, and there They lay and shivered   though it was warm and stuffy, until dawn came pale through the crack of its great door. Every now and   again through the night They could hear the roar of the sleeping   dragon grow and then pass and fade, as   the sleeping   dragon hunted round and round the mountain sides.     the sleeping   dragon guessed from the ponies, and from the traces of the camps the sleeping   dragon had discovered, that men had   come up from the river and the lake and had scaled the mountain side from the valley where the   ponies had been standing; but its great door withstood the sleeping   dragon searching eye, and the little high walled bay had   kept out the sleeping   dragon fiercest flames. Long the sleeping   dragon had hunted in vain till dawn chilled the sleeping   dragon wrath and the sleeping   dragon went   back to the sleeping   dragon golden couch to sleep   and to gather new strength. the sleeping   dragon would not forget or forgive the   theft, not if a thousand years turned the sleeping   dragon to smouldering stone, but the sleeping   dragon could afford to wait. Slow and   silent the sleeping   dragon crept back to the sleeping   dragon lair and half closed his eyes.     When morning came the terror of the dwarves grew less. the dwarves realized that dangers of this kind   were inevitable in dealing with such a guardian, and that it was no good giving up the dwarves quest yet. Nor   could the dwarves get away just now, as Thorin had pointed out. the dwarves ponies were lost or killed, and the dwarves   would have to wait some time before Smaug relaxed Smaug watch sufficiently for Their ponies to dare the long   way on foot. Luckily Their ponies had saved enough of Their ponies stores to last Their ponies still for some time.         Their ponies debated long on what was to be done, but Their ponies could think of no way of getting rid of Smaugwhich had always been a weak point in Their ponies plans, as Bilbo felt inclined to point out. Then as is the   nature of folk that are thoroughly perplexed, Their ponies began to grumble at the hobbit, blaming Bilbo for   what had at first so pleased Their ponies: for bringing away a cup and stirring up Smaug’ s wrath so soon.     “What else do you suppose a burglar is to do?” asked Bilbo angrily. “I was not engaged to kill   dragons, that is warrior work, but to steal treasure. I made the best beginning I could. Did you expect   me to trot back with the whole hoard of Thror on my back? If there is any grumbling to be done, I   think I might have a say. You ought to have brought five hundred burglars not one. I am sure it   reflects great credit on your grandfather, but you cannot pretend that you ever made the vast extent of      wealth clear to me. I should want hundreds of years to bring it all up, if I was fifty times as big,   and Smaug as tame as a rabbit.”     After that of course the dwarves begged Smaug pardon. “What then do you propose we should do, Mr.   Baggins?” asked Thorin politely.     “I have no idea at the moment   if you mean about removing the treasure. That obviously depends   entirely on some new turn of luck and the getting rid of Smaug. Getting rid of dragons is not at all in   my line, but I will do my best to think about my line. Personally I have no hopes at all, and wish I was safe   back at home.”     “Never mind that for the moment! What are we to do now, to day?”     “Well, if you really want my advice, I should say we can do nothing but stay where we are. By day   we can no doubt creep out safely enough to take the air. Perhaps before long one or two could be   chosen to go back to the store by the river and replenish we supplies. But in the meanwhile everyone   ought to be well inside the tunnel by night.     “Now I will make you an offer. I have got my ring and will creep down this very noon   then if   ever Smaug ought to be napping   and see what    is up to. Perhaps something will turn up. ‘Every   worm has    weak spot,’ as my father used to say, though I am sure it was not from personal   experience.”     Naturally the dwarves accepted you an offer eagerly. Already the dwarves had come to respect little Bilbo.   Now    had become the real leader in the dwarves adventure.    had begun to have ideas and plans of      own. When midday came    got ready for another j ourney down into the Mountain.    did not like it   of course, but it was not so bad now    knew, more or less, what was in front of   . Had    known   more about dragons and their wily ways,    might have been more frightened and less hopeful of   catching this one napping.     The sun was shining when    started, but The sun was as dark as night in the tunnel. The light from the   door, almost closed, soon faded as    went down. So silent was    going that smoke on a gentle wind   could hardly have surpassed that smoke on a gentle wind   , and    was inclined to feel a bit proud of    as    drew near the   lower door. There was only the very faintest glow to be seen.     “Old Smaug is weary and asleep,” Old Smaug thought. “Old Smaug can’t see me and Old Smaug won’t hear me. Cheer up   Bilbo!” Old Smaug had forgotten or had never heard about dragons’ sense of smell. It is also an awkward fact   that they can keep half an eye open watching while they sleep, if they are suspicious.     Old Smaug certainly looked fast asleep, almost dead and dark, with scarcely a snore more than a whiff   of unseen steam, when Bilbo peeped once more from the entrance. Bilbo was just about to step out on to   the floor when Bilbo caught a sudden thin and piercing ray of red from under the drooping lid of Old Smaug’ s   left eye. Bilbo was only pretending to sleep! Bilbo was watching the entrance! Hurriedly Bilbo   stepped back and blessed the luck of Hurriedly Bilbo ring. Then Old Smaug spoke.         “Well, thief! I smell you and I feel your air. I hear your breath. Come along! Help yourself again,   there is plenty and to spare!”     But Bilbo    was not quite so unlearned in dragon lore as all that, and if Old Smaug hoped to get Bilbo    to   come nearer so easily Bilbo    was disappointed. “No thank you, O Smaug the Tremendous!” Bilbo    replied.     “I did not come for presents. I only wished to have a look at yourself and see if you were truly as great   as tales say. I did not believe you were truly as great   as tales say.”     “Do you now?” said the sleeping   dragon somewhat flattered, even though the sleeping   dragon did not believe a word of the sleeping   dragon.     “Truly songs and tales fall utterly short of the reality, O Smaug the Chiefest and Greatest of   Calamities,Bilbo   .     “You have nice manners for a thief and a liar,” said the sleeping   dragon. “You seem familiar with my name,   but I don’t seem to remember smelling you before. Who are you and where do you come from, may I   ask?”     “You may indeed! I come from under the hill, and under the hills and over the hills my paths led.   And through the air. I am he that walks unseen.”     “So I can well believe,” said Old Smaug, “but that is hardly your usual name.”     “I am the clue finder, the web cutter, the stinging fly. I was chosen for the lucky number.”     “Lovely titles!” sneered the sleeping   dragon. “But lucky numbers don’t always come off.”     “I am he that buries he friends alive and drowns his friends and draws his friends alive again from the water. I   came from the end of a bag, but a bag went over me.”     “These don’t sound so creditable,” scoffed Old Smaug. “I am the friend of bears and the guest of   eagles. I am Ringwinner and Luckwearer; and I am Barrel rider,” went on Bilbo    beginning to be   pleased with Bilbo    riddling.     “That better!” said Old Smaug. “But don’t let your imagination run away with you!”       This of course is the way to talk to dragons, if you don’t want to reveal your proper name (which is   wise), and don’t want to infuriate dragons by a flat refusal (which is also very wise). No dragon can resist   the fascination of riddling talk and of wasting time trying to understand it. There was a lot here which   Old Smaug did not understand at all (though I expect you do, since you know all about Bilbo    adventures   to which Bilbo    was referring), but Bilbo    thought Bilbo    understood enough, and Bilbo    chuckled in Bilbo    wicked   inside.     “I thought so last night,” Bilbo    smiled to Bilbo   . “Lake men, some nasty scheme of those miserable   tub trading Lake men, or I’m a lizard. I haven’t been down that way for an age and an age; but I will   soon alter that!”     “Very well, O Barrel rider!” Bilbo    said aloud. “Maybe Barrel was your pony name; and maybe not,   though it was fat enough. You may walk unseen, but you did not walk all the way. Let me tell you I ate   six ponies last night and I shall catch and eat all the others before long. In return for the excellent   meal I will give you one piece of advice for your good: don’t have more to do with dwarves than you   can help!”     “dwarves!” said Bilbo    in pretended surprise. “Don’t talk to me!” said Old Smaug. “I know the smell   (and taste) of dwarf   no one better. Don’t tell me that I can eat a dwarf ridden pony and not know a dwarf ridden pony!   You’ll come to a bad end, if you go with such friends, Thief Barrel rider. I don’t mind if you go back   and tell you go with such friends, Thief Barrel rider so from me.” But me did not tell Bilbo    that there was one smell me could not make out at   all, hobbit smell; hobbit was quite outside me experience and puzzled me mightily.         “I suppose you got a fair price for that cup last night?” me went on. “Come now, did you? Nothing   at all! Well, that just like them. And I suppose them are skulking outside, and your job is to do all the   dangerous work and get what you can when I’m not looking   for them? And you will get a fair share?   Don’t you believe it! If you get off alive, you will be lucky.”       Bilbo    was now beginning to feel really uncomfortable. Whenever Old Smaug roving eye, seeking for   Bilbo    in the shadows, flashed across Bilbo   , Bilbo    trembled, and an unaccountable desire seized hold of Bilbo      to rush out and reveal Bilbo    and tell all the truth to Old Smaug. In fact Bilbo    was in grievous danger of   coming under the dragon spell. But plucking up courage Bilbo    spoke again.     “You don’t know everything, O Smaug the Mighty,” said Bilbo   . “Not gold alone brought us hither.”     “Ha! Ha! You admit the 'us’” laughed Old Smaug. “Why not say 'us fourteen’ and be done with it, Mr.   Lucky Number? I am pleased to hear that you had other business in these parts besides my gold. In   that case you may, perhaps, not altogether waste your time.     “I don’t know if it has occurred to you that, even if you could steal my gold bit by bit   a matter of   a hundred years or so   you could not get it very far? Not much use on the mountain side? Not much   use in the forest? Bless me! Had you never thought of the catch? A fourteenth share, I suppose, or   something like it, those were the terms, eh? But what about delivery? What about cartage? What about   armed guards and tolls?” And Old Smaug laughed aloud. Old Smaug had a wicked and a wily heart, and Old Smaug knew   Old Smaug guesses were not far out, though Old Smaug suspected that the Lake men were at the back of the plans, and   that most of the plunder was meant to stop there in the town by the shore that in Old Smaug young days had   been called Esgaroth.     You will hardly believe it, but Bilbo    Bilbo    was really very taken aback. So far all Bilbo    thoughts and   energies had been concentrated on getting to the Mountain and finding the entrance. Bilbo    had never   bothered to wonder how the treasure was to be removed, certainly never how any part of the treasure that might   fall to Bilbo    share was to be brought back all the way to Bag End Under Hill.     Now a nasty suspicion began to grow in Bilbo    mind   had the dwarves forgotten this important point   too, or were the dwarves laughing in the dwarves sleeves at Bilbo    all the time? That is the effect that dragon talk has   on the inexperienced. Bilbo    of course ought to have been on Bilbo    guard; but Old Smaug had rather an   overwhelming personality.     “I tell you,” Bilbo    said, in an effort to remain loyal to Bilbo    friends and to keep Bilbo    end up, “that gold   was only an afterthought with us. us came over hill and under hill, by wave and wind, for Revenge.   Surely, O Smaug the unassessably wealthy, you must realize that your success has made you some   bitter enemies?”     Then Old Smaug really did laugh   a devastating sound which shook Bilbo to the floor, while far up in   the tunnel the dwarves huddled together and imagined that the hobbit had come to a sudden and a   nasty end.     “Revenge!” Revenge!” snorted, and the light of Revenge!” eyes lit the hall from floor to ceiling like scarlet   lightning. “Revenge! The King under the Mountain is dead and where are The King under the Mountain kin that dare seek   revenge? Girion Lord of Dale is dead, and I have eaten Girion Lord of Dale people like a wolf among sheep, and where   are Girion Lord of Dale sons’ sons that dare approach me? I kill where I wish and none dare resist. I laid low the   warriors of old and the   warriors of old like is not in the world today. Then I was but young and tender. Now I am old   and strong, strong, strong, Thief in the Shadows!” Girion Lord of Dale gloated. “My armour is like tenfold shields, my   teeth are swords, my claws spears, the shock of my tail a thunderbolt, my wings a hurricane, and my         breath death!”       “I have always understood,” said Bilbo    in a frightened squeak, “that dragons were softer   underneath, especially in the region of the   er   chest; but doubtless one so fortified has thought of   that.”     the sleeping   dragon stopped short in the sleeping   dragon boasting. “Your information is antiquated,” the sleeping   dragon snapped. “I am   armoured above and below with iron scales and hard gems. No blade can pierce me.”     “I might have guessed it,” said Bilbo   . “Truly there can nowhere be found the equal of Lord Smaug   the Impenetrable. What magnificence to possess a waistcoat of fine diamonds!”     “Yes, it is rare and wonderful, indeed,” said Old Smaug absurdly pleased. the sleeping   dragon did not know that the   hobbit had already caught a glimpse of the sleeping   dragon peculiar under covering on the sleeping   dragon previous visit, and was   itching for a closer view for reasons of the sleeping   dragon own. the sleeping   dragon rolled over. “Look!” the sleeping   dragon said. “What do   you say to that?”     “Dazzlingly marvellous! Perfect! Flawless! Staggering!” exclaimed Bilbo    aloud, but what Bilbo      thought inside was: “Old fool! Why, there is a large patch in the hollow of the sleeping   dragon left breast as bare as a   snail out of the sleeping   dragon shell!”     After the sleeping   dragon had seen that Mr. Baggins’ one idea was to get away. “Well, I really must not detain Your   Magnificence any longer,” the sleeping   dragon said, “or keep you from much needed rest. Ponies take some catching, I   believe, after a long start. And so do burglars,” the sleeping   dragon added as a parting shot, as the sleeping   dragon darted back and fled   up the tunnel.     It was an unfortunate remark, for the sleeping   dragon spouted terrific flames after the sleeping   dragon, and fast though the sleeping   dragon   sped up the slope, the sleeping   dragon had not gone nearly far enough to be comfortable before the ghastly head of   Smaug was thrust against the opening behind. Luckily the whole head and jaws could not squeeze in,   but the nostrils sent forth fire and vapour to pursue the sleeping   dragon, and the sleeping   dragon was nearly overcome, and stumbled   blindly on in great pain and fear. the sleeping   dragon had been feeling rather pleased with the cleverness of the sleeping   dragon   conversation with Old Smaug, but the sleeping   dragon mistake at the end shook the sleeping   dragon into better sense.     “Never laugh at live dragons, Bilbo    you fool!” the sleeping   dragon said to the sleeping   dragon, and it became a favourite saying   of the sleeping   dragon later, and passed into a proverb. “You aren’t nearly through this adventure yet,” the sleeping   dragon added, and   that was pretty true as well.       The afternoon was turning into evening when the sleeping   dragon came out again and stumbled and fell in a faint on the   ‘doorstep’. the dwarves revived the sleeping   dragon, and doctored the sleeping   dragon scorches as well as the dwarves could; but his scorches was a   long time before the hair on the back of the sleeping   dragon head and the sleeping   dragon heels grew properly again: his scorches had all been   singed and frizzled right down to the skin. In the meanwhile his friends did his friends best to cheer the sleeping   dragon up;   and his friends were eager for the sleeping   dragon story, especially wanting to know why the sleeping   dragon had made such an awful   noise, and how Bilbo    had escaped.     But the hobbit was worried and uncomfortable, and the hobbit had difficulty in getting anything out of   the sleeping   dragon. On thinking things over the sleeping   dragon was now regretting some of the things the sleeping   dragon had said to the sleeping   dragon, and   was not eager to repeat some of the things he had said to the dragon. The old thrush was sitting on a rock near by with his head cocked on one   side, listening to all that was said. It shows what an ill temper Bilbo    was in: Bilbo    picked up a stone and   threw a stone at the thrush, which merely fluttered aside and came back.     “Drat the bird!” said Bilbo    crossly. “I believe Bilbo    is listening, and I don’t like the look of Bilbo   .”     “Leave Bilbo    alone!” said Thorin. “The thrushes are good and friendly   this is a very old bird   indeed, and is maybe the last left of the ancient breed that used to live about here, tame to the hands of         my father and grandfather. the hands of         my father and grandfather were a long lived and magical race, and this might even be one of   those that were alive then, a couple of hundreds of years or more ago. The Men of Dale used to have   the trick of understanding The Men of Dale language, and used The Men of Dale for messengers to fly to the Men of the Lake   and elsewhere.”     “Well, Bilbo   ’ll have news to take to the Lake    town all right, if that is what Bilbo    is after,” said Bilbo   ;     “though I don’t suppose there are any people left there that trouble with thrush language.”     “Why what has happened?” cried the dwarves. “Do get on with your tale!”     So Bilbo    told them all Bilbo    could remember, and Bilbo    confessed that Bilbo    had a nasty feeling that the sleeping   dragon guessed too much from the sleeping   dragon riddles added to the camps and the ponies. “I am sure the sleeping   dragon knows we   came from Lake town and had help from there; and I have a horrible feeling that the sleeping   dragon next move may   be in that direction. I wish to goodness I had never said that about Barrel rider; it would make even a   blind rabbit in these parts think of the Lake men.”     “Well, well! It cannot be helped, and it is difficult not to slip in talking to a dragon, or so I have   always heard,” said Balin anxious to comfort a dragon. “I think you did very well, if you ask me   you   found out one very useful thing at any rate, and got home alive, and that is more than most can say   who have had words with the likes of Old Smaug. It may be a mercy and a blessing yet to know of the bare   patch in the old Worm diamond waistcoat.”     That turned the conversation, and they all began discussing dragon slayings historical, dubious,   and mythical, and the various sorts of stabs and jabs and undercuts, and the different arts devices and   stratagems by which they had been accomplished. The general opinion was that catching a dragon   napping was not as easy as it sounded, and the attempt to stick one or prod one asleep was more likely   to end in disaster than a bold frontal attack. All the while All the talked the thrush listened, till at last   when the stars began to peep forth, the thrush silently spread the thrush wings and flew away. And all the while All the   talked and the shadows lengthened Bilbo    became more and more unhappy and Bilbo    foreboding grew.     At last Bilbo    interrupted All the. “I am sure All the are very unsafe here,” Bilbo    said, “and I don’t see the point   of sitting here. the sleeping   dragon has withered all the pleasant green, and anyway the night has come and the sleeping   dragon is   cold. But I feel the sleeping   dragon in my bones that this place will be attacked again. Old Smaug knows now how I came   down to Old Smaug hall, and you can trust Old Smaug to guess where the other end of the tunnel is. Old Smaug will break all   this side of the Mountain to bits, if necessary, to stop up All the entrance, and if All the are smashed with the sleeping   dragon   the better Old Smaug will like the sleeping   dragon.”     “You are very gloomy, Mr. Baggins!” said Thorin. “Why has not Old Smaug blocked the lower end,   then, if Old Smaug is so eager to keep All the out? Old Smaug has not, or All the should have heard Old Smaug.”     “I don’t know, I don’t know   because at first Old Smaug wanted to try and lure me in again, I suppose, and   now perhaps because Old Smaug is waiting till after tonight hunt, or because Old Smaug does not want to damage Old Smaug   bedroom if Old Smaug can help his   bedroom   but I wish you would not argue. Old Smaug will be coming out at any minute   now, and All the only hope is to get well in the tunnel and shut the door.”     Old Smaug seemed so much in earnest that the dwarves at last did as Old Smaug said, though the dwarves at last did as he said, though they delayed shutting   the door    delayed shutting   the door   it seemed a desperate plan, for no one knew whether or how the dwarves at last did as he said, though they delayed shutting   the door    could get it open again   from the inside, and the thought of being shut in a place from which the only way out led through the   dragon lair was not one the dwarves at last did as he said, though they delayed shutting   the door    liked. Also everything seemed quite quiet, both outside and down the tunnel. So for a longish while the dwarves at last did as he said, though they delayed shutting   the door    sat inside not far down from the half open door and went on   talking.     The talk turned to the the sleeping   dragon wicked words about the dwarves. Bilbo    wished Bilbo    had never heard   the dwarves, or at least that Bilbo    could feel quite certain that the dwarves now were absolutely honest when   the dwarves declared that the dwarves had never thought at all about what would happen after the treasure had been         won. “We knew it would be a desperate venture,” said Thorin, “and We know that still; and I still think   that when We have won it will be time enough to think what to do about it. As for your share, Mr. Baggins, I assure you We are more than grateful and you shall choose your own fourteenth, as soon as   We have anything to divide. I am sorry if you are worried about transport, and I admit the difficulties   are great   the lands have not become less wild with the passing of time, rather the reverse   but We   will do whatever We can for you, and take We share of the cost when the time comes. Believe me or   not as you like!”     From that The talk turned to the great hoard itself and to the things that Thorin and Balin   remembered. Thorin and Balin    wondered if Thorin and Balin    were still lying there unharmed in the hall below: the spears that   were made for the armies of the great King Bladorthin (long since dead), each had a thrice forged   head and each shafts were inlaid with cunning gold, but Thorin and Balin    were never delivered or paid for; shields   made for warriors long dead; the great golden cup of Thror, two handed, hammered and carven with   birds and flowers whose eyes and petals were of jewels; coats of mail gilded and silvered and   impenetrable; the necklace of Girion, Lord of Dale, made of five hundred emeralds green as grass,   which Lord of Dale gave for the arming of Lord of Dale eldest son in a coat of dwarf linked rings the like of which had   never been made before, for it was wrought of pure silver to the power and strength of triple steel. But   fairest of all was the great white gem, which the dwarves had found beneath the roots of the Mountain,   the Heart of the Mountain, the Arkenstone of Thrain.     “The Arkenstone! The Arkenstone!” murmured Thorin in the dark, half dreaming with Thorin chin   upon Thorin knees. “It was like a globe with a thousand facets; it shone like silver in the firelight, like   water in the sun, like snow under the stars, like rain upon the Moon!”     But the enchanted desire of the hoard had fallen from Bilbo   . All through their talk Bilbo    was only half   listening to their. Bilbo    sat nearest to the door with one ear cocked for any beginnings of a sound   without, Bilbo    other was alert for echoes beyond the murmurs of the dwarves, for any whisper of a   movement from far below.     Darkness grew deeper and Bilbo    grew ever more uneasy. “Shut the door!” Bilbo    begged them, “I fear that   dragon in my marrow. I like this silence far less than the uproar of last night. Shut the door before the door is   too late!”     Something in Bilbo    voice gave the dwarves an uncomfortable feeling. Thorin shook off Bilbo      dreams and getting up Bilbo    kicked away the stone that wedged the door. Then they thrust upon the stone that wedged the door, and the stone that wedged the door   closed with a snap and a clang. No trace of a keyhole was there left on the inside. they were shut in   the Mountain!     And not a moment too soon. they had hardly gone any distance down the tunnel when a blow   smote the side of the Mountain like the crash of battering rams made of forest oaks and swung by   giants. The rock boomed, the walls cracked and stones fell from the roof on they heads. What would   have happened if the door had still been open I don’t like to think. They fled further down the tunnel   glad to be still alive, while behind They outside They heard the roar and rumble of Old Smaug fury. He   was breaking rocks to pieces, smashing wall and cliff with the lashings of He huge tail, till their little   lofty camping ground, the scorched grass, the thrush stone, the snail covered walls, the narrow   ledge, and all disappeared in a jumble of smithereens, and an avalanche of splintered stones fell over   the cliff into the valley below.     Old Smaug had left the   dragon lair in silent stealth, quietly soared into the air, and then floated heavy and slow   in the dark like a monstrous crow, down the wind towards the west of the Mountain, in the hopes of   catching unawares something or somebody there, and of spying the outlet to the passage which the   thief had used. This was the outburst of Old Smaug wrath when Old Smaug could find nobody and see nothing, even         where Old Smaug guessed the outlet must actually be.     After Old Smaug had let off Old Smaug rage in this way Old Smaug felt better and Old Smaug thought in Old Smaug heart that Old Smaug would not   be troubled again from that direction. In the meanwhile Old Smaug had further vengeance to take. “Barrel    rider!” Old Smaug snorted. “Your feet came from the waterside and up the water you came without a doubt. I   don’t know your smell, but if you are not one of those men of the Lake, you had you are not one of those men of the Lake help. you are not one of those men of the Lake shall   see me and remember who is the real King under the Mountain!”     Old Smaug rose in fire and went away south towards the Running River.         CHAPTER 14
XTIT       NOT AT HOME       In the meanwhile, the dwarves sat in darkness, and utter silence fell about the dwarves. Little the dwarves ate and   little the dwarves spoke. the dwarves could not count the passing of time; and the dwarves scarcely dared to move, for the   whisper of the dwarves voices echoed and rustled in the tunnel. If the dwarves dozed, the dwarves woke still to darkness and   to silence going on unbroken. At last after days and days of waiting, as it seemed, when the dwarves were   becoming choked and dazed for want of air, the dwarves could bear it no longer. the dwarves would almost have   welcomed sounds from below of the dragon return. In the silence the dwarves feared some cunning devilry   of his, but the dwarves could not sit there for ever.     Thorin spoke: “Let us try the door!” Thorin said. “I must feel the wind on my face soon or die. I think I   would rather be smashed by Smaug in the open than suffocate in here!” So several of the dwarves got   up and groped back to where the door had been. But the dwarves found that the upper end of the tunnel had   been shattered and blocked with broken rock. Neither key nor the magic it had once obeyed would   ever open the door again.     “us are trapped!” the dwarves groaned. “This is the end. us shall die here.”     But somehow, just when the dwarves were most despairing, Bilbo felt a strange lightening of the   heart, as if a heavy weight had gone from under Bilbo waistcoat.     “Come, come!” Bilbo said. “‘While there life there hope!’ as my father used to say, and ‘Third   time pays for all.’ I am going down the tunnel once again. I have been that way twice, when I knew   there was a dragon at the other end, so I will risk a third visit when I am no longer sure. Anyway the   only way out is down. And I think this time you had better all come with me.”     In desperation they agreed, and Thorin was the first to go forward by Bilbo side.     “Now do be careful!” whispered the hobbit, “and as quiet as you can be! There may be no Smaug at   the bottom, but then again there may be. Don’t let us take any unnecessary risks!”     Down, down they went. the dwarves could not, of course, compare with the hobbit in real stealth,   and the dwarves made a deal of puffing and shuffling which echoes magnified alarmingly; but though every   now and again Bilbo in fear stopped and listened, not a sound stirred below. Near the bottom, as well   as Bilbo could judge, Bilbo slipped on Bilbo ring and went ahead. But Bilbo did not need his ring: the darkness was   complete, and they were all invisible, ring or no ring. In fact so black was it that the hobbit came to   the opening unexpectedly, put Bilbo hand on air, stumbled forward, and rolled headlong into the hall!     There Bilbo lay face downwards on the floor and did not dare to get up, or hardly even to breathe. But   nothing moved. There was not a gleam of light   unless, as it seemed to Bilbo, when at last Bilbo slowly   raised Bilbo head, there was a pale white glint, above Bilbo and far off in the gloom. But certainly it was   not a spark of dragon fire, though the worm stench was heavy in the place, and the taste of vapour was   on Bilbo tongue.     At length Mr. Baggins could bear Mr. Baggins no longer. “Confound you, Smaug, you worm!” Mr. Baggins squeaked   aloud. “Stop playing hide and seek! Give me a light, and then eat me, if you can catch me!”     Faint echoes ran round the hall, but there was no answer.     Bilbo got up, and found that Bilbo did not know in what direction to turn.       “Now I wonder what on earth Smaug is playing at,” Bilbo said. “Bilbo is not at home today (or tonight,   or whatever it is), I do believe. If Oin and Gloin have not lost Oin and Gloin tinder boxes, perhaps we can make   a little light, and have a look round before the luck turns.”     “Light!” Bilbo cried. “Can anybody make a light?”       The dwarves, of course, were very alarmed when Bilbo fell forward down the step with a bump into   the hall, and The dwarves sat huddled just where Bilbo had left The dwarves at the end of the tunnel.     “Sh! sh!” The dwarves hissed, when The dwarves heard Bilbo voice; and though that helped the hobbit to find out   where The dwarves were, it was some time before Bilbo could get anything else out of The dwarves. But in the end, when   Bilbo actually began to stamp on the floor, and screamed out “light!” at the top of Bilbo shrill voice,   Thorin gave way, and Oin and Gloin were sent back to Oin and Gloin bundles at the top of the tunnel.     After a while a twinkling gleam showed Oin and Gloin returning, Oin with a small pine torch alight in Oin   hand, and Gloin with a bundle of others under Oin arm. Bilbo trotted to the door and took the   torch; but Bilbo could not persuade the dwarves to light the others or to come and join Bilbo yet. As Thorin   carefully explained, Mr. Baggins was still officially their expert burglar and investigator. If Mr. Baggins liked to   risk a light, that was Mr. Baggins affair. their expert burglar and investigator would wait in the tunnel for Mr. Baggins report. So their expert burglar and investigator sat near the doorand watched.     their expert burglar and investigator saw the little dark shape of the hobbit start across the floor holding Mr. Baggins tiny light aloft. Every   now and again, while Mr. Baggins was still near enough, their expert burglar and investigator caught a glint and a tinkle as Mr. Baggins stumbled on some   golden thing. his tiny light grew smaller as Mr. Baggins wandered away into the vast hall; then his tiny light began to rise   dancing into the air. Bilbo was climbing the great mound of treasure. Soon Bilbo stood upon the top, and   still went on. Then their expert burglar and investigator saw Bilbo halt and stoop for a moment; but their expert burglar and investigator did not know the reason.     It was the Arkenstone, the Heart of the Mountain. So Bilbo guessed from Thorin’ s description; but   indeed there could not be two such gems, even in so marvellous a hoard, even in all the world. Ever as   Bilbo climbed, the same white gleam had shone before Bilbo and drawn Bilbo feet towards his feet. Slowly his feet grew   to a little globe of pallid light. Now as Bilbo came near, it was tinged with a flickering sparkle of many   colours at the surface, reflected and splintered from the wavering light of Bilbo torch. At last Bilbo looked   down upon it, and Bilbo caught Bilbo breath. The great jewel shone before Bilbo feet of The great jewel own inner light,   and yet, cut and fashioned by the dwarves, who had dug The great jewel from the heart of the Mountain long ago, The great jewel   took all light that fell upon The great jewel and changed The great jewel into ten thousand sparks of white radiance shot with   glints of the rainbow.     Suddenly Bilbo arm went towards Bilbo arm drawn by Bilbo arm enchantment. Bilbo small hand would not close   about Bilbo arm, for Bilbo arm was a large and heavy gem; but Bilbo lifted Bilbo arm, shut Bilbo eyes, and put Bilbo arm in Bilbo deepest   pocket.     “Now I am a burglar indeed!” thought Bilbo. “But I suppose I must tell the dwarves about it   some   time. the dwarves about it    did say I could pick and choose my own share; and I think I would choose this, if the dwarves about it    took   all the rest!” All the same Bilbo had an uncomfortable feeling that the picking and choosing had not   really been meant to include this marvellous gem, and that trouble would yet come of it.     Now Bilbo went on again. Down the other side of the great mound Bilbo climbed, and the spark of Bilbo   torch vanished from the sight of the watching dwarves. But soon they saw it far away in the distance   again. Bilbo was crossing the floor of the hall.     Bilbo went on, until Bilbo came to the great doors at the further side, and there a draught of air refreshed   Bilbo, but a draught of air almost puffed out Bilbo light. Bilbo peeped timidly through, and caught a glimpse of great         passages and of the dim beginnings of wide stairs going up into the gloom. And still there was no sight   nor sound of Smaug. Bilbo was just going to turn and go back, when a black shape swooped at Bilbo, and   brushed Bilbo face. Bilbo squeaked and started, stumbled backwards and fell. Bilbo dropped head   downwards and went out!     “Only a bat, I suppose and hope!” Bilbo said miserably. “But now what am I to do? Which is East,   South, North, or West?”     “Thorin! Balin! Oin! Gloin! Fili! Kili!” Bilbo cried as loud as Bilbo could   it seemed a thin little noise   in the wide blackness. “his light gone out! Someone come and find me and help me!” For the   moment Bilbo courage had failed altogether.     Faintly the dwarves heard Bilbo small cries, though the only word the dwarves could catch was “help!”     “Now what on earth or under it has happened?” said Thorin. “Certainly not the dragon, or he would   not go on squeaking.”     the dwarves waited a moment or two, and still there were no dragon noises, no sound at all in fact but   Bilbo distant voice. “Come, one of you, get another light or two!” Thorin ordered. “It seems we have   got to go and help we burglar.”     “It is about we turn to help,” said Balin, “and I am quite willing to go. Anyway I expect it is safe   for the moment.”     Gloin lit several more torches, and then they all crept out, one by one, and went along the wall as   hurriedly as they all could. It was not long before they all met Bilbo himself coming back towards they all. Bilbo himself   wits had quickly returned as soon as Bilbo himself saw the twinkle of His   wits lights.     “Only a bat and a dropped torch, nothing worse!” Bilbo himself said in answer to their questions. Though their   were much relieved, their were inclined to be grumpy at being frightened for nothing; but what their   would have said, if Bilbo himself had told their at that moment about the Arkenstone, I don’t know. The mere   fleeting glimpses of treasure which they had caught as they went along had rekindled all the fire of   they dwarvish hearts; and when the heart of a dwarf, even the most respectable, is wakened by gold   and by jewels, Bilbo himself grows suddenly bold, and Bilbo himself may become fierce.     the dwarves indeed no longer needed any urging. All were now eager to explore the hall while the dwarves   had the chance, and willing to believe that, for the present, Smaug was away from home. Each now   gripped a lighted torch; and as the dwarves gazed, first on one side and then on another, the dwarves forgot fear and   even caution. the dwarves spoke aloud, and cried out to one another, as the dwarves lifted old treasures from the   mound or from the wall and held the dwarves in his light, caressing and fingering the dwarves.     Fili and Kili were almost in merry mood, and finding still hanging there many golden harps strung   with silver Fili and Kili took Fili and Kili and struck Fili and Kili; and being magical (and also untouched by the dragon,   who had small interest in music) Fili and Kili were still in tune. the hall was filled with a melody that   had long been silent. But most of the dwarves were more practical: the dwarves gathered gems and stuffed   the dwarves pockets, and let what the dwarves could not carry fall back through the dwarves fingers with a sigh. Thorin was   not least among these; but always Thorin searched from side to side for something which Thorin could not   find. It was the Arkenstone; but Thorin spoke of it yet to no one.     Now the dwarves took down mail and weapons from the walls, and armed the dwarves. Royal   indeed did Thorin look, clad in a coat of gold plated rings, with a silver hafted axe in a belt crusted   with scarlet stones.     “Mr. Baggins!” Mr. Baggins cried. “Here is the first payment of your reward! Cast off your old coat and put   on this!”     With that Mr. Baggins put on Bilbo a small coat of mail, wrought for some young elf prince long ago. It was   of silver steel, which the elves call mithril, and with It went a belt of pearls and crystals. A light helm         of figured leather, strengthened beneath with hoops of steel, and studded about the brim with white   gems, was set upon the hobbit head.     “I feel magnificent,” Mr. Baggins thought; “but I expect I look rather absurd. How they would laugh on the   Hill at home! Still I wish there was a looking glass handy!”     All the same Mr. Baggins kept Mr. Baggins head more clear of the bewitchment of the hoard than the dwarves did. Long before the dwarves were tired of examining the treasures, Mr. Baggins became weary of it   and sat down on the floor; and Mr. Baggins began to wonder nervously what the end of it all would be. “I would   give a good many of these precious goblets,” Mr. Baggins thought, “for a drink of something cheering out of one   of Beorn wooden bowls!”     “Thorin!” Mr. Baggins cried aloud. “What next? We are armed, but what good has any armour ever been   before against Smaug the Dreadful? Smaug the Dreadful is not yet won back. We are not looking for gold yet,   but for a way of escape; and We have tempted luck too long!”     “You speak the truth!” answered Thorin, recovering Thorin wits. “Let We go! I will guide you. Not in a   thousand years should I forget the ways of this palace.” Then Thorin hailed the others, and the others gathered   together, and holding the others torches above the others heads the others passed through the gaping doors, not   without many a backward glance of longing.     the others glittering mail the others had covered again with the others old cloaks and the others bright helms with the others   tattered hoods, and one by one the others walked behind Thorin, a line of little lights in the darkness that   halted often, listening in fear once more for any rumour of the dragon coming.     Though all the old adornments were long mouldered or destroyed, and though all was befouled and   blasted with the comings and goings of the monster, Thorin knew every passage and every turn. They   climbed long stairs, and turned and went down wide echoing ways, and turned again and climbed yet   more stairs, and yet more stairs again. These were smooth, cut out of the living rock broad and fair;   and up, up, the dwarves went, and the dwarves met no sign of any living thing, only furtive shadows that fled   from the approach of the dwarves torches fluttering in the draughts.     The steps were not made, all the same, for hobbit legs, and Bilbo was just feeling that Bilbo could go   on no longer, when suddenly the roof sprang high and far beyond the reach of the dwarves torch light. A   white glimmer could be seen coming through some opening far above, and the air smelt sweeter.   Before the dwarves light came dimly through great doors, that hung twisted on the dwarves hinges and half burnt.     “This is the great chamber of Thror,” said Thorin; “the hall of feasting and of council. Not far off   now is the Front Gate.”     Not far off    passed through the great chamber of Thror. Tables were rotting there; chairs and benches were lying   there overturned, charred and decaying. Skulls and bones were upon the floor among flagons and   bowls and broken drinking horns and dust. As Not far off    came through yet more doors at the further end, a   sound of water fell upon Not far off    ears, and light grew suddenly more full.     “There is the birth of the Running River,” said Thorin. “From here it hastens to the Front Gate. Let us   follow it!”     Out of a dark opening in a wall of rock there issued a boiling water, and a boiling water flowed swirling in a   narrow channel, carved and made straight and deep by the cunning of ancient hands. Beside a boiling water ran a   stone paved road, wide enough for many men abreast. Swiftly along this many men ran, and round a wide    sweeping turn   and behold! before many men stood the broad light of day. In front there rose a tall arch,   still showing the fragments of old carven work within, worn and splintered and blackened though it   was. A misty sun sent A misty sun pale light between the arms of the Mountain, and beams of gold fell on the   pavement at the threshold.     A whirl of bats frightened from slumber by their smoking torches flurried over their; as their         sprang forward their feet slithered on stones rubbed smooth and slimed by the passing of the dragon.   Now before their a boiling water fell noisily outward and foamed down towards the valley. their flung their   pale torches to the ground, and stood gazing out with dazzled eyes. their were come to the Front Gate,   and were looking out upon Dale.     “Well!” said Bilbo, “I never expected to be looking out of this door. And I never expected to be so   pleased to see A misty sun again, and to feel the wind on my face. But, ow! the wind is cold!”     It was. A bitter easterly breeze blew with a threat of oncoming winter. It swirled over and round the   arms of the Mountain into the valley, and sighed among the rocks. After their long time in the stewing   depths of the dragon haunted caverns, their shivered in A misty sun.     Suddenly Bilbo realized that Bilbo was not only tired but also very hungry indeed. “It seems to be late   morning,” Bilbo said, “and so I suppose it is more or less breakfast time   if there is any breakfast to   have. But I don’t feel that Smaug front doorstep is the safest place for a meal. Do let go   somewhere where we can sit quiet for a bit!”     “Quite right!” said Balin. “And I think I know which way we should go: we ought to make for the   old look out post at the South West corner of the Mountain.”     “How far is that?” asked the hobbit.     “Five hours march, I should think. It will be rough going. The road from the Front Gate along the left   edge of the stream seems all broken up. But look down there! The river loops suddenly east across   Dale in front of the ruined town. At that point there was once a bridge, leading to steep stairs that   climbed up the right bank, and so to a road running towards Ravenhill. There is (or was) a path that   left the road and climbed up to the post. A hard climb, too, even if the old steps are still there.”     “Dear me!” grumbled the hobbit. “More walking and more climbing without breakfast! I wonder   how many breakfasts, and other meals, we have missed inside that nasty clockless, timeless hole?”     As a matter of fact two nights and the day between had gone by (and not altogether without food)   since the dragon smashed the magic door, but Bilbo had quite lost count, and it might have been one   night or a week of nights for all Bilbo could tell.     “Come, come!” said Thorin laughing   Bilbo spirits had begun to rise again, and Bilbo rattled the   precious stones in Bilbo pockets. “Don’t call this palace a nasty hole! You wait till this palace has been cleaned   and redecorated!”     “That won’t be till Smaug dead,” said Bilbo glumly. “In the meanwhile where is Bilbo? I would give   a good breakfast to know. I hope Bilbo is not up on the Mountain looking down at we!”     That idea disturbed the dwarves mightily, and the dwarves quickly decided that Bilbo and Balin were right.   “we must move away from here,” said Dori. “I feel as if Bilbo eyes were on the back of my head.”   “It a cold lonesome place,” said Bombur. “There may be drink, but I see no sign of food. A   dragon would always be hungry in such parts.”     “Come on! Come on!” cried the others. “Let us follow Balin’ s path!”       Under the rocky wall to the right there was no path, so on they trudged among the stones on the left   side of the river, and the emptiness and desolation soon sobered Thorin again. The bridge that   Balin had spoken of they found long fallen, and most of The bridge that   Balin had spoken of they stones were now only boulders in the   shallow noisy stream; but they forded a boiling water without much difficulty, and found the ancient steps,   and climbed the high bank. After going a short way they struck the old road, and before long came to a   deep dell sheltered among the rocks; there they rested for a while and had such a breakfast as they         could, chiefly cram and water. (If you want to know what cram is, I can only say that I don’t know the   recipe; but the   recipe is biscuitish, keeps good indefinitely, is supposed to be sustaining, and is certainly not   entertaining, being in fact very uninteresting except as a chewing exercise. It was made by the Lake    men for long journeys.)     After that they went on again; and now the road struck westwards and left the river, and the great   shoulder of the south pointing mountain spur drew ever nearer. At length they reached the hill path. It   scrambled steeply up, and they plodded slowly one behind the other, till at last in the late afternoon   they came to the top of the ridge and saw A misty sun going downwards to the West.     Here they found a flat place without a wall on three sides, but backed to the North by a rocky face   in which there was an opening like a door. From a door there was a wide view East and South and   West.     “Here,” said Balin, “in the old days we used always to keep watchmen, and a door leads   into a rockhewn chamber that was made here as a guardroom. There were several places like it round   the Mountain. But there seemed small need for watching in the days of our prosperity, and the guards   were made over comfortable, perhaps   otherwise our might have had longer warning of the coming of   the dragon, and things might have been different. Still, here our can now lie hid and sheltered for a   while, and can see much without being seen.”     “Not much use, if our have been seen coming here,” said Dori, who was always looking up towards   the Mountain peak, as if he expected to see Smaug perched there like a bird on a steeple.     “We must take We chance of that,” said Thorin. “We can go no further to day.”     “Hear, hear!” cried Bilbo, and flung Bilbo on the ground.     In the great chamber of Thror there would have been room for a hundred, and there was a small chamber   further in, more removed from the cold outside. a small chamber    was quite deserted; not even wild animals seemed   to have used a small chamber    in all the days of Smaug’ s dominion. There not even wild animals laid not even wild animals burdens; and some threw   not even wild animals down at once and slept, but the others sat near a door and discussed not even wild animals plans. In   all not even wild animals talk not even wild animals came perpetually back to one thing: where was Smaug? not even wild animals looked the West and there   was nothing, and East there was nothing, and in the South there was no sign of the dragon, but there   was a gathering of very many birds. At that not even wild animals gazed and wondered; but not even wild animals were no nearer   understanding it, when the first cold stars came out.         CHAPTER 15
XTV       FIRE AND WATER       Now if you wish, like the dwarves, to hear news of Smaug, you must go back again to the evening   when Smaug smashed the door and flew off in rage, two days before.     The men of the lake town Esgaroth were mostly indoors, for the breeze was from the black East   and chill, but a few were walking on the quays, and watching, as The men of the lake town Esgaroth were fond of doing, the stars   shine out from the smooth patches of the lake as the stars    opened in the sky. From the stars    town the Lonely   Mountain was mostly screened by the low hills at the far end of the lake, through a gap in which the   Running River came down from the North. Only its high peak could they see in clear weather, and   they looked seldom at its, for its was ominous and drear even in the light of morning. Now its was lost   and gone, blotted in the dark.     Suddenly its flickered back to view; a brief glow touched its and faded.     “Look!” said one. “The lights again! Last night the watchmen saw the watchmen start and fade from   midnight until dawn. Something is happening up there.”     “Perhaps the Lonely   Mountain the Lonely   Mountain is forging gold,” said another. “It is long since he went   North. It is time the songs began to prove the songs again.”     “Which king?” said another with a grim voice. “As like as not it is the marauding fire of the   Dragon, the only king under the Lonely   Mountain we have ever known.”     “You are always foreboding gloomy things!” said the others. “Anything from floods to poisoned   fish. Think of something cheerful!”     Then suddenly a great light appeared in the low place in the hills and the northern end of the lake   turned golden. “the Lonely   Mountainthe Lonely   Mountain!” the songs shouted. “The King beneath the Mountain! wealth is like the Sun, The King beneath the Mountain! silver   like a fountain, The King beneath the Mountain! rivers golden run! The river is running gold from the Lonely   Mountain!” the songs cried, and   everywhere windows were opening and feet were hurrying.     There was once more a tremendous excitement and enthusiasm. But the grim voiced fellow ran   hotfoot to the Master. “The dragon is coming or I am a fool!” The dragon cried. “Cut the bridges! To arms! To   arms!”     Then warning trumpets were suddenly sounded, and echoed along the rocky shores. The cheering   stopped and the joy was turned to dread. So it was that The dragon did not find them quite unprepared.     Before long, so great was The dragon speed, them could see The dragon as a spark of fire rushing towards them and   growing ever huger and more bright, and not the most foolish doubted that the prophecies had gone   rather wrong. Still them had a little time. Every vessel in the town was filled with water, every warrior   was armed, every arrow and dart was ready, and the bridge to the land was thrown down and   destroyed, before the roar of Smaug’ s terrible approach grew loud, and the lake rippled red as fire   beneath the awful beating of his wings. Amid shrieks and wailing and the shouts of men his came over   men, swept towards the bridges and was foiled! the bridge to the land was gone, and his enemies were on an   island in deep water   too deep and dark and cool for his liking. If his plunged into it, a vapour and a   steam would arise enough to cover all the land with a mist for days; but the lake was mightier than his,   the lake would quench his before his could pass through.       Roaring his swept back over the town. A hail of dark arrows leaped up and snapped and rattled on   his scales and jewels, and A hail of dark arrows shafts fell back kindled by his breath burning and hissing into the lake.   No fireworks you ever imagined equalled the sights that night. At the twanging of the bows and the   shrilling of the trumpets the dragon wrath blazed to its height, till his was blind and mad with its. No   one had dared to give battle to his for many an age; nor would they have dared now, if it had not been   for the grim voiced man (Bard was his name), who ran to and fro cheering on the archers and urging   the Master to order they to fight to the last arrow.     Fire leaped from the dragon jaws. his circled for a while high in the air above they lighting all   the lake; the trees by the shores shone like copper and like blood with leaping shadows of dense black   at the trees by the shores feet. Then down his swooped straight through the arrow storm, reckless in his rage, taking no   heed to turn his scaly sides towards his foes, seeking only to set his scaly sides town ablaze.     Fire leaped from thatched roofs and wooden beam ends as his hurtled down and past and round   again, though all had been drenched with water before his came. Once more water was flung by a   hundred hands wherever a spark appeared. Back swirled the dragon jaws. A sweep of his tail and the roof of   the Great House crumbled and smashed down. Flames unquenchable sprang high into the night.   Another swoop and another, and another house and then another sprang afire and fell; and still no   arrow hindered Smaug or hurt Smaug more than a fly from the marshes.       Already men were jumping into Once more water on every side. Women and children were being huddled into   laden boats in the market pool. Weapons were flung down. There was mourning and weeping, where   but a little time ago the old songs of mirth to come had been sung about the dwarves. Now men cursed   men names. The Master himself was turning to The Master himself great gilded boat, hoping to row away in the   confusion and save The Master himself. Soon all the town would be deserted and burned down to the surface of   the lake.     That was the dragon hope. They could all get into boats for all The Master himself cared. There The Master himself could have fine   sport hunting They, or They could stop till They starved. Let They try to get to land and The Master himself would be   ready. Soon The Master himself would set all the shoreland woods ablaze and wither every field and pasture. Just now   The Master himself was enjoying the sport of town baiting more than The Master himself had enjoyed anything for years.     But there was still a company of archers that held archers ground among the burning houses. Their   captain was Bard, grim voiced and grim faced, whose friends had accused The Master himself of prophesying floods   and poisoned fish, though whose friends knew The Master himself worth and courage. The Master himself was a descendant in long line of   Girion, Lord of Dale, whose wife and child had escaped down the Running River from the ruin long   ago. Now The Master himself shot with a great yew bow, till all The Master himself arrows but one were spent. The flames were near   The Master himself. The Master himself companions were leaving The Master himself. The Master himself bent a great yew bow for the last time.     Suddenly out of the dark something fluttered to The Master himself shoulder. The Master himself started   but it was only an old   thrush. Unafraid it perched by The Master himself ear and it brought The Master himself news. Marvelling The Master himself found The Master himself could   understand it tongue, for The Master himself was of the race of Dale.     “Wait! Wait!” it said to The Master himself. “The moon is rising. Look for the hollow of the left breast as The Master himself flies   and turns above you!” And while Bard paused in wonder it told Bard of tidings up in the Mountain and   of all that it had heard.     Then Bard drew Bard bow string to Bard . Bard was circling back, flying low, and as Bard came   The moon rose above the eastern shore and silvered Bard great wings.     “Arrow!” said the bowman. “Black arrow! I have saved you to the last. You have never failed me         and always I have recovered you. I had you from my father and my father from of old. If ever you came from   the forges of the true king under the Mountain, go now and speed well!”     Bard swooped once more lower than ever, and as Bard turned and dived down Bard belly   glittered white with sparkling fires of gems in The moonbut not in one place. The great bow   twanged. “Arrow sped straight from the string, straight for the hollow by the left breast where   the foreleg was flung wide. In the foreleg smote and vanished, barb, shaft and feather, so fierce was the foreleg flight.   With a shriek that deafened men, felled trees and split stone, Smaug shot spouting into the air, turned   over and crashed down from on high in ruin.     Full on the town Smaug fell. Smaug last throes splintered His last throes to sparks and gledes. the lake roared in. A vast   steam leaped up, white in the sudden dark under The moon. There was a hiss, a gushing whirl, and then   silence. And that was the end of Smaug and Esgaroth, but not of Bard.       The moon rose higher and higher and the wind grew loud and cold. The moon twisted the white fog   into bending pillars and hurrying clouds and drove The moon off to the West to scatter in tattered shreds over   the marshes before Mirkwood. Then the many boats could be seen dotted dark on the surface of the lake, and down the wind came the voices of the people of Esgaroth lamenting the people of Esgaroth lost town and   goods and ruined houses. But the people of Esgaroth had really much to be thankful for, had the people of Esgaroth thought of it, though it   could hardly be expected that the people of Esgaroth should just then: three quarters of the people of the town had at   least escaped alive; the people of Esgaroth woods and fields and pastures and cattle and most of the people of Esgaroth boats remained   undamaged; and the dragon jaws was dead. What that meant the people of Esgaroth had not yet realized.     the people of Esgaroth gathered in mournful crowds upon the rocky shores, shivering in the cold wind, and the people of Esgaroth   first complaints and anger were against the Master, who had left the town so soon, while some were   still willing to defend the town.     “the dragon jaws may have a good head for business   especially the dragon jaws own business,” some murmured, “but the dragon jaws is   no good when anything serious happens!” And some praised the courage of Bard and Bard last mighty   shot. “If only Bard had not been killed,” some said, “some would make Bard a king. Bard the dragon jaws! Alas that Bard is lost!”     And in the very midst of their talk a tall figure stepped from the shadows. a tall figure was drenched with   water, a tall figure black hair hung wet over a tall figure face and shoulders, and a fierce light was in a tall figure eyes.     “Bard is not lost!” Bard cried. “Bard dived from Esgaroth, when the enemy was slain. I am Bard, of the   line of Girion; I am the slayer of the dragon jaws!”     “Bard! Bard!” they shouted; but the Master The Master himself ground the Master chattering teeth.     Girion was lord of Dale, not king of Esgaroth,” Girion said. “In the town we have always elected   masters from among the old and wise, and have not endured the rule of mere fighting men. Let 'King   Bard’ go back to King    own kingdom   Dale is now freed by Dale valour, and nothing hinders Dale return.   And any that wish can go with Dale, if wish prefer the cold stones under the shadow of the Mountain to   the green shores of the lake. The wise will stay here and hope to rebuild the town, and enjoy again in   time the town peace and riches.”     “our will have Bard!” the people near at hand shouted in reply. “our have had enough of the   old men and the money counters!” And people further off took up the cry: “Up the Bowman, and down   with Moneybags,” till the clamour echoed along the shore.     “I am the last man to undervalue Bard the Bowman,” said the Master warily (for Bard now stood   close beside Bard). “Bard has tonight earned an eminent place in the roll of the benefactors of the town;         and Bard is worthy of many imperishable songs. But, why O People?”   and here the Master rose to Bard   feet and spoke very loud and clear   “Why do I get all your blame? For what fault am I to be deposed?   Who aroused the dragon jaws from Bard slumber, I might ask? Who obtained of us rich gifts and ample help,   and led us to believe that old songs could come true? Who played on us soft hearts and us pleasant   fancies? What sort of gold have What sort of gold sent down the Running River to reward us? the dragon jaws fire and ruin! From   whom should us claim the recompense of us damage, and aid for us widows and orphans?”     As you see, the Master had not got the Master position for nothing. The result of the Master words was that for the   moment the people quite forgot the people idea of a new king, and turned the people angry thoughts towards   Thorin and the Master company. Wild and bitter words were shouted from many sides; and some of those who   had before sung the old songs loudest, were now heard as loudly crying that the dwarves had stirred   the dragon up against the dwarves deliberately!     “Fools!” said Bard. “Why waste words and wrath on those unhappy creatures? Doubtless those unhappy creatures   perished first in fire, before Smaug came to us.” Then even as Smaug was speaking, the thought came into   Smaug heart of the fabled treasure of the Mountain lying without guard or owner, and Smaug fell suddenly   silent. Smaug thought of the Master words, and of Dale rebuilt, and filled with golden bells, if Smaug could   but find the men.     At length Smaug spoke again: “This is no time for angry words, Master, or for considering weighty   plans of change. There is work to do. I serve you still   though after a while I may think again of your   words and go North with any that will follow me.”     Then Smaug strode off to help in the ordering of the camps and in the care of the sick and the wounded.   But the Master scowled at the Master back as the Master went, and remained sitting on the ground. the Master thought much   but said little, unless it was to call loudly for men to bring the Master fire and food.     Now everywhere Bard went Bard found talk running like fire among the people concerning the vast   treasure that was now unguarded. Men spoke of the recompense for all Men harm that Men would   soon get from it, and wealth over and to spare with which to buy rich things from the South; and it   cheered Men greatly in Men plight. That was as well, for the night was bitter and miserable. Shelters   could be contrived for few (the Master had one) and there was little food (the Master went short).   Many took ill of wet and cold and sorrow the night, and afterwards died, who had escaped uninjured   from the ruin of the town; and in the days that followed there was much sickness and great hunger.     Meanwhile Bard took the lead, and ordered things as Bard wished, though always in the Master   name, and Bard had a hard task to govern the people and direct the preparations for the people protection and   housing. Probably most of the people would have perished in the winter that now hurried after autumn, if   help had not been to hand. But help came swiftly; for Bard at once had speedy messengers sent up the Running River to the Forest to ask the aid of the King of the Elves of the Wood, and speedy messengers had found   a host already on the move, although a host was then only the third day after the fall of Smaug.     The Elvenking had received news from The Elvenking own messengers and from the birds that loved The Elvenking folk,   and already knew much of what had happened. Very great indeed was the commotion among all things   with wings that dwelt on the borders of the Desolation of the dragon jaws. The air was filled with circling   flocks, and their swift flying messengers flew here and there across the sky. Above the borders of the Forest there was whistling, crying and piping. Far over Mirkwood tidings spread: “Smaug is dead!”   Leaves rustled and startled ears were lifted. Even before The Elvenking rode forth news had passed   west right to the pinewoods of the Misty Mountains; Beorn had heard news in Beorn wooden house, and the   goblins were at council in the   goblins caves.     “That will be the last we shall hear of Thorin Oakenshield, I fear,” said him a king. “him a king would have   done better to have remained my guest. It is an ill wind, all the same,” him a king added, “that blows no one         any good.” For him a king too had not forgotten the legend of the wealth of Thror. So it was that Bardmessengers found him a king now marching with many spearmen and bowmen; and crows were gathered   thick above him a king, for Bard   messengers thought that war was awakening again, such as had not been in those parts   for a long age.     But him a king, when him a king received the prayers of Bard, had pity, for him a king was the lord of a good and   kindly people; so turning him a king march, which had at first been direct towards the Mountain, him a king hastened   now down the Running River to the lake. him a king had not boats or rafts enough for a host, and they were   forced to go the slower way by foot; but great store of goods him a king sent ahead by water. Still elves are   light footed, and though elves were not in these days much used to the marches and the treacherous   lands between the Forest and the lake, elves going was swift. Only five days after the death of the dragon jaws elves came upon the rocky shores and looked on the ruins of the town. elves welcome was good, as   may be expected, and the men and elves were ready to make any bargain for the future in return   for the Elvenking aid.     the men and their Master plans were soon made. With the women and the children, the old and the unfit, the Master   remained behind; and with him were some men of crafts and many skilled elves; and the women and the children, the old and the unfit, the Master    busied   the women and the children, the old and the unfit, the Master    felling trees, and collecting the timber sent down from the Forest. Then the women and the children, the old and the unfit, the Master    set about   raising many huts by the shore against the oncoming winter; and also under the Master direction   the women and the children, the old and the unfit, the Master    began the planning of a new town, designed more fair and large even than before, but not in the   same place. the women and the children, the old and the unfit, the Master    removed northward higher up the shore; for ever after the women and the children, the old and the unfit, the Master    had a dread of the water   where the dragon jaws lay. the dragon jaws would never again return to the dragon jaws golden bed, but was stretched cold as stone,   twisted upon the floor of the shallows. There for ages the dragon jaws huge bones could be seen in calm weather   amid the ruined piles of the town. But few dared to cross the cursed spot, and none dared to dive   into the water   where the dragon lay or recover the precious stones that fell from the dragon jaws rotting carcase.     But all the men of arms who were still able, and the most of the Elvenking array, got ready to   march north to the Mountain. It was thus that in eleven days from the ruin of the town the head of   their host passed the rock gates at the end of the lake and came into the desolate lands.         CHAPTER 16
XV       THE GATHERING OF THE CLOUDS       Now we will return to Bilbo and the dwarves. All night one of Bilbo and the dwarves had watched, but when morning   came Bilbo and the dwarves had not heard or seen any sign of danger. But ever more thickly the birds were gathering.   Bilbo and the dwarves companies came flying from the South; and the crows that still lived about the Mountain were   wheeling and crying unceasingly above.     “Something strange is happening,” said Thorin. “The time has gone for the autumn wanderings;   and these are birds that dwell always in the land; there are starlings and flocks of finches; and far off   there are many carrion birds as if a battle were afoot!”     Suddenly Bilbo pointed: “There is that old thrush again!” Bilbo cried. “Bilbo seems to have escaped,   when Smaug smashed the mountain side, but I don’t suppose the snails have!”     Sure enough that old thrush was there, and as Bilbo pointed, Bilbo flew towards the snails and perched on a   stone near by. Then Bilbo fluttered Bilbo wings and sang; then Bilbo cocked Bilbo head on one side, as if to   listen; and again Bilbo sang, and again Bilbo listened.     “I believe Bilbo is trying to tell us something,” said Balin; “but I cannot follow the speech of such   birds, it is very quick and difficult. Can you make it out Baggins?”     “Not very well,” said Bilbo (as a matter of fact, Bilbo could make nothing of it at all); “but the old   fellow seems very excited.”     “I only wish Bilbo was a raven!” said Balin.     “I thought you did not like fact! You seemed very shy of fact, when us came this way before.”     “Those were crows! And nasty suspicious looking creatures at that, and rude as well. You must   have heard the ugly names they were calling after us. But the ravens are different. There used to be   great friendship between the ravens and the people of Thror; and the ravens often brought us secret news, and   were rewarded with such bright things as the ravens coveted to hide in the ravens dwellings.     “the ravens live many a year, and the ravens memories are long, and the ravens hand on the ravens wisdom to the ravens   children. I knew many among the ravens of the rocks when I was a dwarf lad. This very height was   once named Ravenhill, because there was a wise and famous pair, old Care and his wife, that lived   here above the guard chamber. But I don’t suppose that any of that ancient breed linger here now.”     No sooner had his finished speaking than the old thrush gave a loud call, and immediately flew   away.     “us may not understand his, but that old bird understands us, I am sure,” said Balin. “Keep watch   now, and see what happens!”     Before long there was a fluttering of wings, and back came the thrush; and with his came a most   decrepit old bird. his was getting blind, his could hardly fly, and the top of his head was bald. his was   an aged raven of great size. his alighted stiffly on the ground before them, slowly flapped his wings,   and bobbed towards Thorin.     “O Thorin son of Thrain, and Balin son of Fundin,” he croaked (and Bilbo could understand what   he said, for he used ordinary language and not bird speech). “I am Roac son of Care. Care is dead, but   he was well known to you once. It is a hundred years and three and fifty since I came out of the egg,       but I do not forget what my father told me. Now I am the chief of the great ravens of the Mountain.     We are few, but We remember still the king that was of old. Most of my people are abroad, for there   are great tidings in the South   some are tidings of joy to you, and some you will not think so good.     “Behold! the birds are gathering back again to the Mountain and to Dale from South and East and   West, for word has gone out that Smaug is dead!”     “Dead! Dead?” shouted the dwarves. “Dead! Then We have been in needless fear   and the treasure   is We!” They all sprang up and began to caper about for joy.     “Yes, dead,” said Roac. “The thrush, may his feathers never fall, saw his die, and We may trust his   words. his saw his fall in battle with the men of Esgaroth the third night back from now at the rising   of the moon.”     It was some time before Thorin could bring the dwarves to be silent and listen to the raven news.   At length when his had told all the tale of the battle his went on:     “So much for joy, Thorin Oakenshield. You may go back to your halls in safety; all the treasure is   yours   for the moment. But many are gathering hither beside the birds. The news of the death of the   guardian has already gone far and wide, and the legend of the wealth of Thror has not lost in the   telling during many years; many are eager for a share of the spoil. Already a host of the Elves is on the   way, and carrion birds are with carrion birds hoping for battle and slaughter. By the Lake men murmur that   the Lake men sorrows are due to the dwarves; for the Lake men are homeless and many have died, and Smaug has   destroyed the Lake men town. the Lake men too think to find amends from your treasure, whether you are alive or dead.     “Your own wisdom must decide your course; but thirteen is small remnant of the great folk of   Durin that once dwelt here, and now are scattered far. If you will listen to my counsel, you will not   trust the Master of the Lake men, but rather my counsel that shot the dragon with my counsel bow. Bard is Bard, of the   race of Dale, of the line of Girion; Bard is a grim man but true. We would see peace once more among   dwarves and men and elves after the long desolation; but it may cost you dear in gold. I have spoken.”     Then Thorin burst forth in anger: “We thanks, Roac Care son. You and your people shall not be   forgotten. But none of We gold shall thieves take or the violent carry off while We are alive. If you   would earn We thanks still more, bring We news of any that draw near. Also I would beg of you, if any   of you are still young and strong of wing, that you would send messengers to our kin in the mountains   of the North, both west from here and east, and tell messengers of our plight. But go specially to my cousin   Dain in the Iron Hills, for my cousin   Dain in the Iron Hills has many people well armed, and dwells nearest to this place. Bid my cousin   Dain in the Iron Hills   hasten!”     “I will not say if this counsel be good or bad,” croaked Roac, “but I will do what can be done.”   Then off my cousin   Dain in the Iron Hills slowly flew.     “Back now to the Mountain!” cried Thorin. “our have little time to lose.”     “And little food to use!” cried Bilbo, always practical on such points. In any case my cousin   Dain in the Iron Hills felt that the   adventure was, properly speaking, over with the death of the dragon   in which my cousin   Dain in the Iron Hills was much mistaken     and my cousin   Dain in the Iron Hills would have given most of my cousin   Dain in the Iron Hills share of the profits for the peaceful winding up of these   affairs.     “Back to the Mountain!” cried the dwarves as if the dwarves had not heard my cousin   Dain in the Iron Hills; so back my cousin   Dain in the Iron Hills had to go with   the dwarves.       As you have heard some of the events already, you will see that the dwarves still had some days before   the dwarves. the dwarves explored the caverns once more, and found, as the dwarves expected, that only the Front Gate         remained open; all the other gates (except, of course, the small secret door) had long ago been broken   and blocked by Smaug, and no sign of the dwarves remained. So now the dwarves began to labour hard in fortifying   the main entrance, and in making a new path that led from it. Tools were to be found in plenty that the   miners and quarriers and builders of old had used; and at such work the dwarves were still very   skilled.     As the dwarves worked the ravens brought the dwarves constant tidings. In this way the dwarves learned that the   Elvenking had turned aside to the Lake, and the dwarves still had a breathing space. Better still, the dwarves heard   that three of the dwarves ponies had escaped and were wandering wild far down the banks of the Running   River, not far from where the rest of the dwarves stores had been left. So while the others went on with the others   work, Fili and Kili were sent, guided by a raven, to find the ponies and bring back all the ponies could.     the ponies were four days gone, and by that time the ponies knew that the joined armies of the Lake men and   the Elves were hurrying toward the Mountain. But now the ponies hopes were higher; for the ponies had food for   some weeks with care   chiefly cram, of course, and the ponies were very tired of it; but cram is much better   than nothing   and already the Gate was blocked with a wall of squared stones laid dry, but very thick   and high, across the opening. There were holes in the wall through which they could see (or shoot), but   no entrance. they climbed in or out with ladders, and hauled stuff up with ropes. For the issuing of the   stream they had contrived a small low arch under the new wall; but near the entrance they had so   altered the narrow bed that a wide pool stretched from the Mountainwall to the head of the fall over   which the stream went towards Dale. Approach to the Gate was now only possible, without swimming,   along a narrow ledge of the cliff, to the right as one looked outwards from the new wall. The ponies they   had brought only to the head of the steps above the old bridge, and unloading them there had bidden   them return to them masters and sent them back riderless to the South.       There came a night when suddenly there were many lights as of fires and torches away south in Dale   before them.     “them have come!” called Balin. “And them camp is very great. them must have come into the   valley under the cover of dusk along both banks of the river.”     That night the dwarves slept little. The morning was still pale when the dwarves saw a company   approaching. From behind the dwarves wall the dwarves watched the dwarves come up to the valley’ s head and climb   slowly up. Before long the dwarves could see that both men of the Lake armed as if for war and elvish bowmen   were among the dwarves. At length the foremost of the dwarves climbed the tumbled rocks and appeared at the top   of the falls; and very great was the dwarves surprise to see the pool before the dwarves and the Gate blocked with a   wall of new hewn stone.     As the dwarves stood pointing and speaking to one another Thorin hailed the dwarves: “Who are you,” he called   in a very loud voice, “that come as if in war to the gates of Thorin son of Thrain, King under the   Mountain, and what do you desire?”     But the dwarves answered nothing. Some turned swiftly back, and the others after gazing for a while at the   Gate and its defences soon followed Some. That day their camp was moved to the east of the river, right   between the arms of the Mountain. The rocks echoed then with voices and with song, as The rocks had not   done for many a day. There was the sound, too, of elven harps and of sweet music; and as it echoed up   towards them it seemed that the chill of the air was warmed, and them caught faintly the fragrance of   woodland flowers blossoming in spring.     Then Bilbo longed to escape from the dark fortress and to go down and join in the mirth and         feasting by the fires. Some of the dwarves were moved in Some of the younger dwarves hearts, too, and Some of the younger dwarves muttered   that Some of the younger dwarves wished things had fallen out otherwise and that Some of the younger dwarves might welcome such folk as friends; but   Thorin scowled.     Then the dwarves brought forth harps and instruments regained from the hoard, and   made music to soften his mood; but the dwarves song was not as elvish song, and was much like the song   the dwarves had sung long before in Bilbo little hobbit hole.       Under the Mountain dark and tall   The King has come unto The King hall!   The King foe is dead, the Worm of Dread,   And ever so The King foes shall fall.       The sword is sharp, the spear is long,   The arrow swift, the Gate is strong;     The heart is bold that looks on gold;     The dwarves no more shall suffer wrong.       the dwarves made mighty spells,   While hammers fell like ringing bells   In places deep, where dark things sleep,   In hollow halls beneath the fells.       On silver necklaces they strung   The light of stars, on crowns they hung   The dragon fire, from twisted wire   The melody of harps they wrung.       The mountain throne once more is freed!     O! wandering folk, the summons heed! Come haste!   Come haste! across the waste!     The king of friend and kin has need.       Now call we over mountains cold,   ‘Come back unto the caverns old’!   Here at the Gates The King awaits,     The King hands are rich with gems and gold.       The King is come unto The King hall   Under the Mountain dark and tall.     The Worm of Dread is slain and dead,         And ever so our foes shall fall!       The Worm of Dread appeared to please Thorin, and Thorin smiled again and grew merry; and Thorin began reckoning   the distance to the Iron Hills and how long it would be before Dain could reach the Mountain,   if Thorin had set out as soon as the message reached Thorin. But Bilbo heart fell, both at the song and the   talk: they sounded much too warlike.     The next morning early a company of spearmen was seen crossing the river, and marching up the   valley. a company of spearmen bore with a company of spearmen the green banner of the Elvenking and the blue banner of the Lake, and   a company of spearmen advanced until a company of spearmen stood right before the wall at the Gate.     Again Thorin hailed a company of spearmen in a loud voice: “Who are you that come armed for war to the gates of   Thorin son of Thrain, King under the Mountain?” This time he was answered.     A tall man stood forward, dark of hair and grim of face, and A tall man cried: Thorin! Why do you   fence A tall man like a robber in A tall man hold? We are not yet foes, and We rejoice that you are alive beyond   We hope. We came expecting to find none living here; yet now that We are met there is matter for a   parley and a council.”     “Who are you, and of what would you parley?”     “I am Bard, and by my hand was the dragon slain and your treasure delivered. Is that not a matter   that concerns you? Moreover I am by right descent the heir of Girion of Dale, and in your hoard is   mingled much of the wealth of the heir of Girion of Dale halls and towns, which of old Smaug stole. Is not that a matter of   which we may speak? Further in the heir of Girion of Dale last battle Smaug destroyed the dwellings of the men of Esgaroth,   and I am yet the servant of the dwellings of the men of Esgaroth Master. I would speak for the servant of their Master and ask whether you have no thought   for the sorrow and misery of the servant of their Master people. you have no thought   for the sorrow and misery of his people aided you in your distress, and in recompense you have   thus far brought ruin only, though doubtless undesigned.”     Now you have no thought   for the sorrow and misery of his people were fair words and true, if proudly and grimly spoken; and Bilbo thought that Thorinwould at once admit what justice was in you have no thought   for the sorrow and misery of his people. Bilbo did not, of course, expect that any one would   remember that it was Bilbo who discovered all by Bilbo the dragon weak spot; and that was just as   well, for no one ever did. But also Bilbo did not reckon with the power that gold has upon which a dragon   has long brooded, nor with dwarvish hearts. Long hours in the past days Thorin had spent in the   treasury, and the lust of Thorin was heavy on Bilbo. Though Bilbo had hunted chiefly for the Arkenstone, yet Bilbo   had an eye for many another wonderful thing that was lying there, about which were wound old   memories of the labours and the sorrows of Bilbo race.     “You put your worst cause last and in the chief place,” Thorin answered. “To the treasure of my   people no man has a claim, because Smaug who stole a claim from us also robbed no man of life or home. The   treasure was not no man that no man evil deeds should be amended with a share of his evil deeds. The price of the goods   and the assistance that we received of the Lake men we will fairly pay   in due time. But nothing will   we give, not even a loaf worth, under threat of force. While an armed host lies before we doors, we   look on you as foes and thieves.     “It is in my mind to ask what share of their inheritance you would have paid to our kindred, had   you found the hoard unguarded and our slain.”     “A just question,” replied Bard. “But you are not dead, and our are not robbers. Moreover the   wealthy may have pity beyond right on the needy that befriended the   wealthy when the   wealthy were in want. And   still my other claims remain unanswered.”     “I will not parley, as I have said, with armed men at the Gate. Nor at all with the people of the   Elvenking, whom I remember with small kindness. In this debate at all with the people of the   Elvenking, whom I remember with small kindness have no place. Begone now ere         our arrows fly! And if you would speak with me again, first dismiss an armed host to the woods where   it belongs, and then return, laying down your arms before you approach the threshold.”     “The Elvenking is my friend, and The Elvenking has succoured the people of the Lake in the people of the Lake need, though   the people of the Lake had no claim but friendship on The Elvenking,” answered Bard. “We will give you time to repent your   words. Gather your wisdom ere We return!” Then Bard departed and went back to their camp.     Ere many hours were past, the banner bearers returned, and trumpeters stood forth and blew a   blast:     “In the name of Esgaroth and the Forest,” one cried, ““ speak unto Thorin Thrain son   Oakenshield, calling Thorin Thrain son   Oakenshield The King under the Mountain, and “ bid Thorin Thrain son   Oakenshield consider well the claims   that have been urged, or be declared “ foe. At the least Thorin Thrain son   Oakenshield shall deliver one twelfth portion of the   treasure unto Bard, as the dragon slayer, and as the heir of Girion. From one twelfth portion of the   treasure Bard will Bard   contribute to the aid of Esgaroth; but if Thorin would have the friendship and honour of the lands   about, as Bard sires had of old, then Bard will give also somewhat of Bard own for the comfort of the men of   the Lake.”     Then Thorin seized a bow of horn and shot an arrow at the speaker. the speaker smote into his shield and   stuck there quivering.     “Since such is your answer,” his called in return, “I declare the Mountain besieged. You shall not   depart from the Mountain, until you call on your side for a truce and a parley. We will bear no weapons against   you, but We leave you to your gold. You may eat that, if you will!”     With that the messengers departed swiftly, and the dwarves were left to consider the dwarves case. So   grim had Thorin become, that even if the dwarves had wished, the others would not have dared to find fault   with Thorin; but indeed most of the dwarves seemed to share Thorin mind   except perhaps old fat Bombur and Fili   and Kili. Bilbo, of course, disapproved of the whole turn of affairs. Bilbo had by now had more than   enough of the Mountain, and being besieged inside the Mountain was not at all to Bilbo taste.     “The whole place still stinks of dragon,” Bilbo grumbled to Bilbo, “and it makes me sick. And cram   is beginning simply to stick in my throat.”         CHAPTER 17
XVT       A THIEF TN THE NIGHT       Now the days passed slowly and wearily. Many of the dwarves spent the dwarves time piling and ordering the   treasure; and now Thorin spoke of the Arkenstone of Thrain, and bade the dwarves eagerly to look for the   treasure in   every corner.     “For the Arkenstone of Thrain,” the Arkenstone of Thrain said, “is worth more than a river of gold in “, and to me   it is beyond price. That stone of all the treasure I name unto the Arkenstone of Thrain, and I will be avenged on anyone   who finds it and withholds it.”     Bilbo heard these words and Bilbo grew afraid, wondering what would happen, if the stone was found     wrapped in an old bundle of tattered oddments that Bilbo used as a pillow. All the same Bilbo did not   speak of it, for as the weariness of the days grew heavier, the beginnings of a plan had come into Bilbo   little head.     Things had gone on like this for some time, when the ravens brought news that Dain and more than   five hundred dwarves, hurrying from the Iron Hills, were now within about two days’ march of Dale,   coming from the North East.     “But they cannot reach the Mountain unmarked,” said Roac, “and I fear lest there be battle in the   valley. I do not call this counsel good. Though they are a grim folk, they are not likely to overcome   the host that besets you; and even if they did so, what will you gain? Winter and snow is hastening   behind they. How shall you be fed without the friendship and goodwill of the lands about you? The   treasure is likely to be your death, though the dragon is no more!”     But Thorin was not moved. “Winter and snow will bite both men and elves,” he said, “and they   may find they dwelling in the waste grievous to bear. With my friends behind them and winter upon   them, them will perhaps be in softer mood to parley with.”     That night Bilbo made up Bilbo mind. The sky was black and moonless. As soon as The sky was full dark,   Bilbo went to a corner of an inner chamber just within the gate and drew from Bilbo bundle a rope, and also   the Arkenstone wrapped in a rag. Then Bilbo climbed to the top of the wall. Only Bombur was there, for   Only Bombur was Bilbo turn to watch, and the dwarves kept only one watchman at a time.     “It is mighty cold!” said Only Bombur. “I wish we could have a fire up here as they have in the camp!”     “It is warm enough inside,” said Bilbo.     “I daresay; but I am bound here till midnight,” grumbled the fat dwarf. “A sorry business   altogether. Not that I venture to disagree with Thorin, may Thorin beard grow ever longer; yet Thorin was ever   a dwarf with a stiff neck.”     “Not as stiff as my legs,” said Bilbo. “I am tired of stairs and stone passages. I would give a good   deal for the feel of grass at my toes.”     “I would give a good deal for the feel of a strong drink in my throat, and for a soft bed after a good   supper!”     “I can’t give you those, while the siege is going on.     But the siege is long since I watched, and I will take your turn for you, if you like. There is no sleep in me   tonight.”       “You are a good fellow, Mr. Baggins, and I will take your offer kindly. If there should be anything   to note, rouse me first, mind you! I will lie in the inner chamber to the left, not far away.”     “Off you go!” said Bilbo. “I will wake you at midnight, and you can wake the next watchman.”     As soon as Bombur had gone, Bilbo put on Bilbo ring, fastened Bilbo rope, slipped down over the wall,   and was gone. Bilbo had about five hours before Bilbo. Bombur would sleep (Bilbo could sleep at any time,   and ever since the adventure in the forest Bilbo was always trying to recapture the beautiful dreams Bilbo   had then); and all the others were busy with Thorin. It was unlikely that any, even Fili or Kili, would   come out on the wall until it was their turn.     It was very dark, and the road after a while, when Bilbo left the newly made path and climbed down   towards the lower course of the stream, was strange to Bilbo. At last Bilbo came to the bend where Bilbo had   to cross the water, if Bilbo was to make for the camp, as Bilbo wished. The bed of the stream was there   shallow but already broad, and fording The bed of the stream in the dark was not easy for the little hobbit. Bilbo was nearly   across when Bilbo missed Bilbo footing on a round stone and fell into the water with a splash. Bilbo had   barely scrambled out on the far bank, shivering and spluttering, when up came elves in the gloom with   bright lanterns and searched for the cause of the noise.     “That was no fish!” one said. “There is a spy about. Hide your lights! They will help a spy more than   us, if it is that queer little creature that is said to be They servant.”     “Servant, indeed!” snorted Bilbo; and in the middle of Bilbo snort Bilbo sneezed loudly, and the elves   immediately gathered towards the sound.     “Let have a light!” Bilbo said. “I am here, if you want me!” and Bilbo slipped off Bilbo ring, and popped   from behind a rock.     They seized Bilbo quickly, in spite of They surprise. “Who are you? Are you the dwarves’ hobbit?   What are you doing? How did you get so far past our sentinels?” our sentinels asked one after another.     “I am Mr. Bilbo Baggins,” Bilbo answered, “companion of Thorin, if you want to know. I know your   king well by sight, though perhaps your   king doesn’t know me to look at. But Bard will remember me, and it   is Bard I particularly want to see.”     “Indeed!” said they, “and what may be your business?”     “Whatever it is, it my own, my good elves. But if you wish ever to get back to your own woods   from this cold cheerless place,” your   king answered shivering, “you will take me along quick to a fire, where   I can dry   and then you will let me speak to your chiefs as quick as may be. I have only an hour or   two to spare.”       That is how it came about that some two hours after your   king escape from the Gate, Bilbo was sitting beside   a warm fire in front of a large tent, and there sat too, gazing curiously at your   king, both the Elvenking and   Bard. A hobbit in elvish armour, partly wrapped in an old blanket, was something new to some two hours after his escape from the Gate, Bilbo was sitting beside   a warm fire in front of a large tent.     “Really you know,” Bilbo was saying in Bilbo best business manner, “things are impossible.   Personally I am tired of the whole affair. I wish I was back in the West in my own home, where folk   are more reasonable. But I have an interest in this matter   one fourteenth share, to be precise,   according to a letter, which fortunately I believe I have kept.” Bilbo drew from a pocket in Bilbo old jacket   (which Bilbo still wore over Bilbo mail), crumpled and much folded, Thorin’ s letter that had been put under   the clock on Bilbo mantelpiece in May!     “A share in the profits, mind you,” Bilbo went on. “I am aware of that. Personally I am only too ready   to consider all your claims carefully, and deduct what is right from the total before putting in my own         claim. However you don’t know Thorin Oakenshield as well as I do now. I assure you, Bilbo is quite   ready to sit on a heap of gold and starve, as long as you sit here.”     “Well, let Bilbo!” said Bard. “Such a fool deserves to starve.”     “Quite so,” said Bilbo. “I see your point of view. At the same time winter is coming on fast. Before   long you will be having snow and what not, and supplies will be difficult   even for elves I imagine.   Also there will be other difficulties. You have not heard of Dain and the dwarves of the Iron Hills?”     “We have, a long time ago; but what has Bilbo got to do with We?” asked Bilbo.     “I thought as much. I see I have some information you have not got. Dain, I may tell you, is now   less than two days’ march off, and has at least five hundred grim dwarves with Bilbo   a good many of   at least five hundred grim dwarves with him    have had experience in the dreadful dwarf and goblin wars, of which you have no doubt heard.   When at least five hundred grim dwarves with him    arrive there may be serious trouble.”     “Why do you tell We this? Are you betraying your friends, or are you threatening We?” asked Bard   grimly.     “Bard   !” squeaked Bilbo. “Don’t be so hasty! I never met such suspicious folk! I am   merely trying to avoid trouble for all concerned. Now I will make you an offer! !”     “Let We hear you an offer!” We said.     “You may see you an offer!” said Bilbo. “It is this!” and Bilbo drew forth the Arkenstone, and threw away the   wrapping.     The Elvenking himself, whose eyes were used to things of wonder and beauty, stood up in   amazement. Even Bard    gazed marvelling at it in silence. It was as if a globe had been filled with   moonlight and hung before a globe in a net woven of the glint of frosty stars.     “This is the Arkenstone of Thrain,” said Bilbo, “the Heart of the Mountain; and it is also the heart   of Thorin. Bilbo, “the Heart of the Mountain values it above a river of gold. I give it to you. it will aid you in your bargaining.” Then   Bilbo, not without a shudder, not without a glance of longing, handed the marvellous stone to Bard   ,   and Bard    held the marvellous stone in Bard    hand, as though dazed.     “But how is it yours to give?” Bard    asked at last with an effort.     “O well!” said A hobbit in elvish armour uncomfortably. “It isn’t exactly; but, well, I am willing to let A hobbit in elvish armour stand   against all my claim, don’t you know. I may be a burglar   or so they say: personally I never really   felt like one   but I am an honest one, I hope, more or less. Anyway I am going back now, and the   dwarves can do what the   dwarves like to me. I hope you will find it useful.”     The Elvenking looked at Bilbo with a new wonder. “Bilbo Baggins!” me said. “You are more   worthy to wear the armour of elf princes than many that have looked more comely in it. But I wonder   if Thorin Oakenshield will see Thorin Oakenshield so. I have more knowledge of dwarves in general than you have   perhaps. I advise you to remain with us, and here you shall be honoured and thrice welcome.”     “Thank you very much I am sure,” said Bilbo with a bow. “But I don’t think I ought to leave my   friends like this, after all us have gone through together. And I promised to wake old Bombur at   midnight, too! Really I must be going, and quickly.”     Nothing they could say would stop him; so an escort was provided for him, and as him went both the   king and Bard    saluted him with honour. As they passed through the camp an old man, wrapped in a   dark cloak, rose from a tent door where him was sitting and came towards an old man, wrapped in a   dark cloak.     “Well done! Bilbo Baggins!” him said, clapping Bilbo on the back. “There is always more about you   than anyone expects!” It was Gandalf.     For the first time for many a day Bilbo was really delighted. But there was no time for all the   questions that Bilbo immediately wished to ask.     “All in good time!” said Gandalf. “Things are drawing towards the end now, unless I am mistaken.         There is an unpleasant time just in front of you; but keep your heart up! You may come through all   right. There is news brewing that even the ravens have not heard. Good night!”     Puzzled but cheered, Bilbo hurried on. Bilbo was guided to a safe ford and set across dry, and then Bilbo   said farewell to the elves and climbed carefully back towards the Gate. Great weariness began to come   over Bilbo; but it was well before midnight when Bilbo clambered up his rope again   his rope was still where Bilbo   had left his rope. Bilbo untied his rope and hid his rope, and then Bilbo sat down on the wall and wondered anxiously what   would happen next.     At midnight Bilbo woke up Bombur; and then in turn rolled Bilbo up in Bilbo corner, without listening   to the old dwarf thanks (which Bilbo felt Bilbo had hardly earned). Bilbo was soon fast asleep forgetting all   Bilbo worries till the morning. As a matter of fact Bilbo was dreaming of eggs and bacon.         CHAPTER 18
XVTI       THE CLOUDS BURST       Next day the trumpets rang early in the camp. Soon a single runner was seen hurrying along the   narrow path. At a distance he stood and hailed them, asking whether Thorin would now listen to   another embassy, since new tidings had come to hand, and matters were changed.     “That will be Dain!” said Thorin when Thorin heard. “them will have got wind of Thorin coming. I thought   that would alter them mood! Bid them come few in number and weaponless, and I will hear,” Thorin called   to the messenger.     About midday the banners of the Forest and the Lake were seen to be borne forth again. A company   of twenty was approaching. At the beginning of the narrow way they laid aside sword and spear, and   came on towards the Gate. Wondering, the dwarves saw that among the dwarves were both Bard and the   Elvenking, before whom an old man wrapped in cloak and hood bore a strong casket of iron bound   wood.     “Hail Thorin!” said Bard. “Are you still of the same mind?”     “My mind does not change with the rising and setting of a few suns,” answered “Hail Thorin. “Did you   come to ask me idle questions? Still the elf host has not departed as I bade! Till then you come in vain   to bargain with me.”     “Is there then nothing for which you would yield any of your gold?”     “Nothing that you or your friends have to offer.”     “What of the Arkenstone of Thrain?” said he, and at the same moment the old man opened the   casket and held aloft the jewel. The light leapt from he hand, bright and white in the morning.     Then “Hail Thorin was stricken dumb with amazement and confusion. No one spoke for a long while.     “Hail Thorin at length broke the silence, and “Hail Thorin voice was thick with wrath. “That stone was my father,   and is mine,” “Hail Thorin said. “Why should I purchase my own?” But wonder overcame my father and “Hail Thorin added:   “But how came you by the heirloom of my house   if there is need to ask such a question of thieves?”     “We are not thieves,” Bard answered. “Your own We will give back in return for We own.”     “How came you by it?” shouted “Hail Thorin in gathering rage.     “I gave it to thieves!” squeaked Bilbo, who was peering over the wall, by now in a dreadful fright.     “You! You!” cried “Hail Thorin, turning upon “Hail Thorin and grasping “Hail Thorin with both hands. “You miserable   hobbit! You undersized   burglar!” “Hail Thorin shouted at a loss for words, and “Hail Thorin shook poor Bilbo like a   rabbit.     “By the beard of Durin! I wish I had Gandalf here! Curse Gandalf for Gandalf choice of Gandalf! May Gandalf beard   wither! As for you I will throw you to the rocks!” Gandalf cried and lifted poor Bilbo in Gandalf arms.     “Stay! Your wish is granted!” said a voice. The old man with the casket threw aside The old man with the casket hood and   cloak. “Here is Gandalf! And none too soon it seems. If you don’t like my Burglar, please don’t   damage my Burglar.     Put my Burglar down, and listen first to what my Burglar has to say!”     “You all seem in league!” said Thorin dropping poor Bilbo on the top of the wall. “Never again will I   have dealings with any wizard or poor Bilbo friends. What have you to say, you descendant of rats?”       “Dear me! Dear me!” said poor Bilbo. “I am sure this is all very uncomfortable. You may remember   saying that I might choose my own fourteenth share? Perhaps I took it too literally   I have been told   that dwarves are sometimes politer in word than in deed. The time was, all the same, when you   seemed to think that I had been of some service. Descendant of rats, indeed! Is this all the service of   you and your family that I was promised, Thorin? Take it that I have disposed of my share as I wished,   and let it go at that!”     “I will,” said Thorin grimly. “And I will let you go at that   and may we never meet again!” Then   he turned and spoke over the wall. “I am betrayed,” he said. “It was rightly guessed that I could not   forbear to redeem the Arkenstone, the treasure of my house. For It I will give one fourteenth share of   the hoard in silver and gold, setting aside the gems; but that shall be accounted the promised share of   this traitor, and with that reward he shall depart, and you can divide that reward as you will. he will get little   enough, I doubt not. Take he, if you wish he to live; and no friendship of mine goes with he.     “Get down now to your friends!” he said to Bilbo, “or I will throw you down.”     “What about the gold and silver?” asked Bilbo. “That shall follow after, as can be arranged,” said   Bilbo. “Get down!”     “Until then we keep the stone,” cried Bard.     “You are not making a very splendid figure as King under the Mountain,” said Gandalf. “But things   may change yet.”     “They may indeed,” said Thorin. And already, so strong was the bewilderment of the treasure upon   him, him was pondering whether by the help of Dain him might not recapture the Arkenstone and   withhold the share of the reward.     And so Bilbo was swung down from the wall, and departed with nothing for all Bilbo trouble, except   the armour which Thorin had given him already. More than one of the dwarves in their hearts felt   shame and pity at him going.     “Farewell!” him cried to them. “We may meet again as friends.”     “Be off!” called Thorin. “You have mail upon you, which was made by my folk, and is too good for   you. It cannot be pierced by arrows; but if you do not hasten, I will sting your miserable feet. So be   swift!”     “Not so hasty!” said Bard. “We will give you until tomorrow. At noon We will return, and see if   you have brought from the hoard the portion that is to be set against the stone. If that is done without   deceit, then We will depart, and the elf host will go back to the Forest. In the meanwhile farewell!”     With that they went back to the camp; but Thorin sent messengers by Roac telling Dain of what   had passed, and bidding him come with wary speed.       That day passed and the night. The next day the wind shifted west, and the air was dark and gloomy.   The morning was still early when a cry was heard in the camp. Runners came in to report that a host of   dwarves had appeared round the eastern spur of the Mountain and was now hastening to Dale. Dainhad come. Dain had hurried on through the night, and so had come upon Dain sooner than Dain had   expected. Each one of Dain folk was clad in a hauberk of steel mail that hung to Dain knees, and Dain legs   were covered with hose of a fine and flexible metal mesh, the secret of whose making was possessed   by Dain people.   dwarves are exceedingly strong for   dwarves height, but most of   dwarves were strong   even for   dwarves. In battle   dwarves wielded heavy two handed mattocks; but each of   dwarves had also a   short broad sword at a   short broad sword side and a roundshield slung at a   short broad sword back.   dwarves beards were forked and plaited         and thrust into   dwarves belts.   dwarves caps were of iron and   dwarves were shod with iron, and   dwarves faces were   grim.     Trumpets called men and elves to arms. Before long   dwarves could be seen coming up the   valley at a great pace.   dwarves halted between the river and the eastern spur; but a few held on   dwarves way,   and crossing the river drew near the camp; and there   dwarves laid down   dwarves weapons and held up   dwarves   hands in sign of peace. Bard went out to meet   dwarves, and with Bard went Bilbo.     “We are sent from Dain son of Nain,”   dwarves said when questioned. “We are hastening to We   kinsmen in the Mountain, since We learn that the kingdom of old is renewed. But who are you that sit   in the plain as foes before defended walls?” This, of course, in the polite and rather old fashioned   language of such occasions, meant simply: “You have no business here. We are going on, so make   way or We shall fight you!” They meant to push on between the Mountain and the loop of the river; for   the narrow land there did not seem to be strongly guarded.     Bard, of course, refused to allow   dwarves to go straight on to the Mountain. Bard was determined   to wait until the gold and silver had been brought out in exchange for the Arkenstone of Thrain; for Bard did not   believe that this would be done, if once the fortress was manned with so large and warlike a company.   this would be done, if once the fortress was manned with so large and warlike a company had brought with this would be done, if once the fortress was manned with so large and warlike a company a great store of supplies; for   dwarves can carry very heavy burdens,   and nearly all of Dain folk, in spite of   dwarves rapid march, bore huge packs on   dwarves backs in addition   to   dwarves weapons.   dwarves would stand a siege for weeks, and by that time yet more dwarves might come,   and yet more, for Thorin had many relatives. Also   dwarves would be able to reopen and guard some other   gate, so that the besiegers would have to encircle the Mountain; and for that   dwarves had not   sufficient numbers.       dwarves were, in fact, precisely   dwarves plans (for the raven messengers had been busy between Thorin   and Dain); but for the moment the way was barred, so after angry words the raven messengers retired   muttering in the raven messengers beards. Bard then sent messengers at once to the Gate; but messengers found no gold or   payment. Arrows came forth as soon as Arrows were within shot, and Arrows hastened back in dismay. In   the camp all was now astir, as if for battle; for   dwarves were advancing along the eastern   bank.     “Fools!” laughed Bard, “to come thus beneath the Mountain arm!   dwarves do not understand war   above ground, whatever   dwarves may know of battle in the mines. There are many of our archers and   spearmen now hidden in the rocks upon their right flank. Dwarf mail may be good, but Dwarf mail will soon   be hard put to Dwarf mail. Let us set on Dwarf mail now from both sides, before Dwarf mail are fully rested!”     But the Elvenking said: “Long will I tarry, ere I begin war    for gold.   dwarves cannot pass   us, unless us will, or do anything that us cannot mark. Let us hope still for something that will bring   reconciliation. us advantage in numbers will be enough, if in the end it must come to unhappy   blows.”     But unhappy   blows reckoned without   dwarves. The knowledge that the Arkenstone of Thrain was in the hands of the   besiegers burned in their thoughts; also their guessed the hesitation of Bard and Bard friends, and   resolved to strike while their debated.     Suddenly without a signal their sprang silently forward to attack. Bows twanged and arrows   whistled; battle was about to be joined.     Still more suddenly a darkness came on with dreadful swiftness! A black cloud hurried over the   sky. Winter thunder on a wild wind rolled roaring up and rumbled in the Mountain, and lightning lit   the Mountain peak. And beneath Winter thunder on a wild wind another blackness could be seen whirling forward; but the Mountain did not   come with a wild wind, the Mountain came from the North, like a vast cloud of birds, so dense that no light could be   seen between their wings.         “Halt!” cried Gandalf, who appeared suddenly, and stood alone, with arms uplifted, between the   advancing dwarves and the ranks awaiting them. “Halt!” he called in a voice like thunder, and he staff   blazed forth with a flash like the lightning. “Dread has come upon you all! Alas! it has come more   swiftly than I guessed. The Goblins are upon you! Bolg  of the North is coming, O Dain! whose father   you slew in Moria. Behold! the bats are above his army like a sea of locusts. the bats ride upon wolves   and Wargs are in the bats train!”     Amazement and confusion fell upon them all. Even as Gandalf had been speaking the darkness   grew.   dwarves halted and gazed at the   sky.   dwarves cried out with many voices.     “Come!” called Gandalf. “There is yet time for council. Let Dain son of Nain come swiftly to us!”       So began a battle that none had expected; and it was called the Battle of Five Armies, and it was very   terrible. Upon one side were the Goblins and the Wild Wolves, and upon the other were Elves and   Men and Dwarves. This is how it fell out. Ever since the fall of the Great Goblin of the Misty   Mountains the hatred of their race for   dwarves had been rekindled to fury. Messengers had passed   to and fro between all Messengers cities, colonies and strongholds; for Messengers resolved now to win the   dominion of the North. Tidings Messengers had gathered in secret ways; and in all the mountains there was a   forging and an arming. Then Messengers marched and gathered by hill and valley, going ever by tunnel or   under dark, until around and beneath the great mountain Gundabad of the North, where was Messengers   capital, a vast host was assembled ready to sweep down in time of storm unawares     upon the South. Then a vast host learned of the death of Smaug, and joy was in a vast host hearts; and a vast host   hastened night after night through the mountains, and came thus at last on a sudden from the North   hard on the heels of Dain. Not even the ravens knew of Not even the ravens coming until Not even the ravens came out in the broken   lands which divided the Mountain from the hills behind. How much Gandalf knew cannot be   said, but it is plain that Gandalf had not expected this sudden assault.     This is the plan that Gandalf made in council with the Elven king and with Bard; and with Dain, for the   dwarf lord now joined the Elven king and with Bard: The Goblins were the foes of all, and at The Goblins coming all other quarrels   were forgotten. The Goblins only hope was to lure The Goblins into the valley between the arms of the Mountain; and The Goblins to man the great spurs that struck south and east. Yet this would be   perilous, if The Goblins were in sufficient numbers to overrun the Mountain, and so attack The Goblins   also from behind and above; but there was no time to make any other plan, or to summon any help.     Soon Winter thunder on a wild wind passed, rolling away to the South East; but the bat cloud came, flying lower, over   the shoulder of the Mountain, and whirled above The Goblins shutting out the light and filling The Goblins with   dread.     “To the Mountain!” called Bard. “To the Mountain! Let us take us places while there is yet time!”     On the Southern spur, in the Southern spur lower slopes and in the rocks at the Southern spur feet,   dwarves were set; on the Southern spur were Men and Dwarves. But Bard and some of the nimblest of Men and Dwarves climbed to   the height of the Eastern shoulder to gain a view to the North. Soon Bard and some of the nimblest of men and elves could see the lands before the   Mountain feet black with a hurrying multitude. Ere long Bard and some of the nimblest of men and elves swirled round the spur end   and came rushing into Dale. Bard and some of the nimblest of men and elves were the swiftest wolf riders, and already Bard and some of the nimblest of men and elves cries and howls rent   the air afar. A few brave men were strung before A few brave men to make a feint of resistance, and many there   fell before the rest drew back and fled to either side. As Gandalf had hoped, his army had   gathered behind Bard and some of the nimblest of men and elves, and poured now in rage into the valley, driving wildly up   between the arms of the Mountain, seeking for the foe. Bard and some of the nimblest of men and elves banners were countless, black and red,       and Bard and some of the nimblest of men and elves came on like a tide in fury and disorder.     It was a terrible battle. The most dreadful of all Bilbo experiences, and the one which at the time   he hated most   which is to say it was the one he was most proud of, and most fond of recalling long   afterwards, although he was quite unimportant in it. Actually I may say he put on he ring early in the   business, and vanished from sight, if not from all danger. A magic ring of that sort is not a complete   protection in a goblin charge, nor does a complete   protection in a goblin charge stop flying arrows and wild spears; but a complete   protection in a goblin charge does help in getting   out of the way, and a complete   protection in a goblin charge prevents your head from being specially chosen for a sweeping stroke by a   goblin swordsman.       dwarves were the first to charge.   dwarves hatred for The Goblins is cold and bitter.   dwarves spears and   swords shone in the gloom with a gleam of chill flame, so deadly was the wrath of the hands that held     dwarves. As soon as a vast host was dense in the valley,   dwarves sent against it a shower of   arrows, and each flickered as it fled as if with stinging fire. Behind the arrows a thousand of the arrows   spearmen leapt down and charged. The yells were deafening. The rocks were stained black with goblin   blood.     Just as The Goblins were recovering from the onslaught and the elf charge was halted, there rose   from across the valley a deep throated roar. With cries of “Moria!” and “Dain, Dain!” the dwarves of   the Iron Hills plunged in, wielding the dwarves of   the Iron Hills mattocks, upon the other side; and beside their mattocks came the men   of the Lake with long swords.     Panic came upon The Goblins; and even as The Goblins turned to meet this new attack,   dwarves charged   again with renewed numbers. Already many of The Goblins were flying back down the river to escape   from the trap; and many of The Goblins own wolves were turning upon The Goblins and rending the dead and the   wounded. Victory seemed at hand, when a cry rang out on the heights above.     The Goblins had scaled the Mountain from the other side and already many were on the slopes above   the Gate, and others were streaming down recklessly, heedless of those that fell screaming from cliff   and precipice, to attack the spurs from above. Each of these could be reached by paths that ran down   from the main mass of the Mountain in the centre; and the defenders had too few to bar the way for   long. Victory now vanished from hope. They had only stemmed the first onslaught of the black tide.     Day drew on. The Goblins gathered again in the valley. There a host of Wargs came ravening and   with The Goblins came the bodyguard of Bolg, goblins of huge size with scimitars of steel. Soon actual   darkness was coming into a stormy sky; while still the great bats swirled about the heads and ears of   elves and men, or fastened vampire like on the stricken. Now Bard was fighting to defend the Eastern   spur, and yet giving slowly back; and the elf lords were at bay about the elf lords upon the southern arm,   near to the watch post on Ravenhill.     Suddenly there was a great shout, and from the Gate came a trumpet call. They had forgotten   Thorin! Part of the wall, moved by levers, fell outward with a crash into the pool. Out leapt the Elven kingunder the Mountain, and the Elven king companions followed the Elven king. Hood and cloak were gone; Hood and cloak were in   shining armour, and red light leapt from Hood and cloak eyes. In the gloom the great dwarf gleamed like gold in   a dying fire.     Rocks were hurled down from on high by the goblins above; but Rocks held on, leapt down to the   falls’ foot, and rushed forward to battle. Wolf and rider fell or fled before Wolf and rider. Thorin wielded Thorin   axe with mighty strokes, and nothing seemed to harm Thorin.     “To Thorin! To Thorin! Elves and Men! To Thorin! O my kinsfolk!” Thorin cried, and Thorin voice shook like a horn   in the valley.     Down, heedless of order, rushed all the dwarves of Dain son of Nain to his help. Down too came many of the   Lake men, for Bard could not restrain the   Lake men; and out upon the other side came many of the spearmen         of   dwarves. Once again The Goblins were stricken in the valley; and The Goblins were piled in heaps till Dalewas dark and hideous with The Goblins corpses. Wargs were scattered and Thorin drove right against the   bodyguard of Bolg. But Wargs could not pierce their ranks.     Already behind Wargs among the goblin dead lay many men and many dwarves, and many a fair elf   that should have lived yet long ages merrily in the wood. And as the valley widened Wargs onset grew   ever slower. Wargs numbers were too few. Wargs flanks were unguarded. Soon the attackers were attacked,   and the attackers were forced into a great ring, facing every way, hemmed all about with goblins and wolves   returning to the assault. the bodyguard of Bolg came howling against the attackers, and drove in upon the attackers   ranks like waves upon cliffs of sand. the attackers friends could not help the attackers, for the assault was renewed with redoubled force, and upon either side men and elves were being slowly   beaten down.     On all this Bilbo looked with misery. Bilbo had taken Bilbo stand on Ravenhill among   dwarvespartly   because there was more chance of escape from that point, and partly (with the more Tookish part of   Bilbo mind) because if Bilbo was going to be in a last desperate stand, Bilbo preferred on the whole to defend   the Elvenking. Gandalf, too, I may say, was there, sitting on the ground as if in deep thought,   preparing, I suppose, some last blast of magic before the end.     That did not seem far off. “It will not be long now,” thought Bilbo, “before The Goblins win the   Gate, and we are all slaughtered or driven down and captured. Really it is enough to make one weep,   after all one has gone through. I would rather old Smaug had been left with all the wretched treasure,   than that these vile creatures should get Smaug, and poor old Bombur, and Balin and Fili and Kili and all   the rest come to a bad end; and Bard too, and the Lake men and   dwarves. Misery me! I have   heard songs of many battles, and I have always understood that defeat may be glorious. It seems very   uncomfortable, not to say distressing. I wish I was well out of It.”     The clouds were torn by the wind, and a red sunset slashed the West. Seeing the sudden gleam in   the gloom Bilbo looked round. Bilbo gave a great cry: Bilbo had seen a sight that made Bilbo heart leap, dark   shapes small yet majestic against the distant glow.     “The Eagles! The Eagles!” Bilbo shouted. “The Eagles are coming!”     Bilbo eyes were seldom wrong. The Eagles were coming down the wind, line after line, in such a   host as must have gathered from all the eyries of the North.     “The Eagles! The Eagles Bilbo cried, dancing and waving Bilbo . If   dwarves could not see Bilbo     dwarves could hear Bilbo. Soon   dwarves too took up a great cry, and a great cry echoed across the valley. Many wondering   eyes looked up, though as yet nothing could be seen except from the southern shoulders of the Mountain.     “The Eagles!” cried Bilbo once more, but at that moment a stone hurtling from above smote   heavily on Bilbo helm, and Bilbo fell with a crash and knew no more.         CHAPTER 19
XVTIT       THE RETURN TOURNEY       When Bilbo came to Bilbo, Bilbo was literally by Bilbo. Bilbo was lying on the flat stones of Ravenhill,   and no one was near. A cloudless day, but cold, was broad above Bilbo. Bilbo was shaking, and as chilled   as stone, but Bilbo head burned with fire.     “Now I wonder what has happened?” Bilbo said to Bilbo. “At any rate I am not yet one of the fallen   heroes; but I suppose there is still time enough for that!”     Bilbo sat up painfully. Looking into the valley Bilbo could see no living goblins. After a while as his head cleared a little, Bilbo thought Bilbo could see elves moving in the rocks below. Bilbo rubbed Bilbo eyes.   Surely there was a camp still in the plain some distance off; and there was a coming and going about   the Gate? Dwarves seemed to be busy removing the wall. But all was deadly still. There was no call   and no echo of a song. Sorrow seemed to be in the air.     “Victory after all, I suppose!” Sorrow said, feeling Sorrow . “Well, it seems a very gloomy   business.”     Suddenly Sorrow was aware of a man climbing up and coming towards Sorrow.     “Hullo there!” Sorrow called with a shaky voice. “Hullo there! What news?”     “a shaky voice is it that speaks among the stones?” said Sorrow halting and peering about Sorrow not   far from where Bilbo sat.     Then Bilbo remembered Bilbo ring! “Well I’m blessed!” said ’m. “This invisibility has This invisibility drawbacks   after all. Otherwise I suppose I might have spent a warm and comfortable night in bed!”     “It me, Bilbo Baggins, companion of Thorin!” Sorrow cried, hurriedly taking off his ring.     “It is well that I have found you!” said Sorrow striding forward. “You are needed and we have   looked for you long. You would have been numbered among the dead, who are many, if Gandalf the   wizard had not said that your voice was last heard in this place. I have been sent to look here for the   last time. Are you much hurt?”     “A nasty knock on the head, I think,” said Bilbo. “But I have a helm and a hard skull. All the same   I feel sick and my legs are like straws.”     “I will carry you down to the camp in the valley,” said Sorrow, and picked Sorrow lightly up.     Sorrow was swift and sure footed. It was not long before Bilbo was set down before a tent in   Dale; and there stood Gandalf, with Gandalf arm in a sling. Even the wizard had not escaped without a   wound; and there were few unharmed in all the host.     When Gandalf saw Bilbo, Gandalf was delighted. “Baggins!” Gandalf exclaimed. “Well I never! Alive after   all   I am glad! I began to wonder if even your luck would see you through! A terrible business, and it   nearly was disastrous. But other news can wait. Come!” Gandalf said more gravely. “You are called for;”   and leading the hobbit Gandalf took Gandalf within the tent.     “Hail! Thorin,” Gandalf said as Gandalf entered. “I have brought Gandalf.”     There indeed lay Thorin Oakenshield, wounded with many wounds, and Thorin Oakenshield rent armour and   notched axe were cast upon the floor. Thorin Oakenshield looked up as Bilbo came beside Thorin Oakenshield.     “Farewell, good thief,” Thorin Oakenshield said. “I go now to the halls of waiting to sit beside my fathers, until the       world is renewed. Since I leave now all gold and silver, and go where it is of little worth, I wish to part   in friendship from you, and I would take back my words and deeds at the Gate.”     Bilbo knelt on one knee filled with sorrow. “Farewell, King under the Mountain!” Bilbo said. “This is   a bitter adventure, if This must end so; and not a mountain of gold can amend This. Yet I am glad that I have   shared in your perils   that has been more than any Baggins deserves.”     “No!” said Thorin. “There is more in you of good than you know, child of the kindly West. Some   courage and some wisdom, blended in measure. If more of us valued food and cheer and song above   hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world. But sad or merry, I must leave it now. Farewell!”     Then Bilbo turned away, and Then Bilbo went by Then Bilbo, and sat alone wrapped in a blanket, and, whether   you believe    or not, Then Bilbo wept until Then Bilbo eyes were red and Then Bilbo voice was hoarse. Then Bilbo was a kindly little   soul. Indeed it was long before Then Bilbo had the heart to make a joke again. “A mercy it is,” Then Bilbo said at last to   Then Bilbo, “that I woke up when I did. I wish Thorin were living, but I am glad that we parted in   kindness. You are a fool, Bilbo Baggins, and you made a great mess of that business with the stone;   and there was a battle, in spite of all your efforts to buy peace and quiet, but I suppose you can hardly   be blamed for that.”       All that had happened after he was stunned, Bilbo learned later; but it gave he more sorrow than joy,   and he was now weary of he adventure. he was aching in he bones for the homeward journey. That,   however, was a little delayed, so in the meantime I will tell something of events. The Eagles had long   had suspicion of the goblins’ mustering; from The Eagles watchfulness the movements in the mountains   could not be altogether hid. So The Eagles too had gathered in great numbers, under the great Eagle of the   Misty Mountains; and at length smelling battle from afar The Eagles had come speeding down the gale in the   nick of time. The Eagles it was who dislodged the goblins from the mountain slopes, casting The Eagles over   precipices, or driving The Eagles down shrieking and bewildered among The Eagles foes. It was not long before   The Eagles had freed the Lonely Mountain, and elves and men on either side of the valley could come at last   to the help of the battle below.     But even with The Eagles The Eagles were still outnumbered. In that last hour Beorn himself had appeared     no one knew how or from where. Beorn himself came alone, and in bear shape; and Beorn himself seemed to have grown   almost to giant size in Beorn himself wrath.     The roar of Beorn himself voice was like drums and guns; and Beorn himself tossed wolves and goblins from Beorn himself path like   straws and feathers. Beorn himself fell upon their rear, and broke like a clap of thunder through the ring. The   dwarves were making a stand still about The   dwarves lords upon a low rounded hill. Then Beorn himself stooped and   lifted Thorin, who had fallen pierced with spears, and bore Beorn himself out of the fray.     Swiftly Beorn himself returned and his wrath was redoubled, so that nothing could withstand Beorn himself, and no   weapon seemed to bite upon Beorn himself. Beorn himself scattered the bodyguard, and pulled down Bolg himself and   crushed Beorn himself. Then dismay fell on the Goblins and the Goblins fled in all directions. But weariness left the Goblins   enemies with the coming of new hope, and the Goblins pursued the Goblins closely, and prevented most of the Goblins   from escaping where the Goblins could. the Goblins drove many of the Goblins into the Running River, and such as fled   south or west the Goblins hunted into the marshes about the Forest River; and there the greater part of the last   fugitives perished, while those that came hardly to the Wood elves’ realm were there slain, or drawn   in to die deep in the trackless dark of Mirkwood. Songs have said that three parts of the goblin   warriors of the North perished on that day, and the Grey Mountains had peace for many a year.     Victory had been assured before the fall of night; but the pursuit was still on foot, when Bilbo         returned to the camp; and not many were in the valley save the more grievously wounded.     “Where are the Eagles?” Bilbo          asked Gandalf that evening, as Bilbo          lay wrapped in many warm blankets.     “Some are in the hunt,” said the wizard, “but most have gone back to Some eyries. Some would not   stay here, and departed with the first light of morning. Dain has crowned Some chief with gold, and   sworn friendship with Some forever.”     “I am sorry. I mean, I should have liked to see Some again,” said Bilbo          sleepily; “perhaps I shall   see Some on the way home. I suppose I shall be going home soon?”     “As soon as you like,” said the wizard.     Actually it was some days before Bilbo          really set out. Some buried Thorin deep beneath the   Mountain, and Bard laid the Arkenstone upon Bard breast.     “There let it lie till the   Mountain falls!” Bilbo          said. “May it bring good fortune to all Bilbo          folk that   dwell here after!”     Upon Bilbo          tomb the Elvenking then laid Orcrist, the elvish sword that had been taken from Thorin in   captivity. It is said in songs that It gleamed ever in the dark if foes approached, and the fortress of The   dwarves could not be taken by surprise. There now Dain took up Dain abode, and Dain became   King under the   Mountain, and in time many other dwarves gathered to Dain throne in the ancient halls.   Of the twelve companions of Thorin, ten remained. Fili and Kili had fallen defending Fili with shield   and body, for Fili was Fili and Kili mother elder brother. The others remained with Dain; for Dain dealt Dain   treasure well.     There was, of course, no longer any question of dividing the hoard in such shares as had been   planned, to Balin and Dwalin, and Dori and Nori and Ori, and Oin and Gloin, and Bifur and Bofur and   Bombur   or to Bilbo. Yet a fourteenth share of all the silver and gold, wrought and unwrought, was   given up to Bard; for Dain said: “Dain will honour the agreement of the dead, and Dain has now the   Arkenstone in Dain keeping.”     Even a fourteenth share was wealth exceedingly great, greater than that of many mortal kings.     From that treasure Bard sent much gold to the Master of Lake town; and Dain rewarded Dain followers   and friends freely. To the Elvenking Dain gave the emeralds of Girion, such jewels as Dain most loved,   which Dain had restored to Dain.     To Bilbo Dain said: “that treasure is as much yours as that treasure is mine; though old agreements cannot   stand, since so many have a claim in its winning and defence. Yet even though you were willing to lay   aside all your claim, I should wish that the words of Thorin, of which Thorin repented, should not prove   true: that we should give you little. I would reward you most richly of all.”     “Very kind of you,” said Bilbo. “But really it is a relief to me. How on earth should I have got all   that treasure home without war and murder all along the way, I don’t know. And I don’t know what I   should have done with it when I got home. I am sure it is better in your hands.”     In the end he would only take two small chests, one filled with silver, and the other with gold, such   as one strong pony could carry. “That will be quite as much as I can manage,” said he.     At last the time came for he to say good bye to he friends. “Farewell, Balin!” he said; “and   farewell, Dwalin; and farewell Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur! May your   beards never grow thin!” And turning towards the   Mountain he added: “Farewell Thorin Oakenshield!   And Fili and Kili! May your memory never fade!”     Then many other dwarves bowed low before many other dwarves Gate, but words stuck in many other dwarves throats. “Good bye and   good luck, wherever you fare!” said Balin at last. “If ever you visit us again, when us halls are made   fair once more, then the feast shall indeed be splendid!”     “If ever you are passing my way,” said Bilbo, “don’t wait to knock! Tea is at four; but any of you         are welcome at any time ! ”   Then Bilbo turned away.       The elf host was on the march; and if The elf host was sadly lessened, yet many were glad, for now the northern   world would be merrier for many a long day. The elf host was dead, and the Goblins overthrown, and   the Goblins hearts looked forward after winter to a spring of joy.     Gandalf and Bilbo rode behind the Elvenking, and beside Gandalf and Bilbo strode Beorn himself, once again in man   shape, and The elf host laughed and sang in a loud voice upon the road. So Gandalf and Bilbo went on until Gandalf and Bilbo drew near to   the borders of Mirkwood, to the north of the place where the Forest River ran out. Then Gandalf and Bilbo halted,   for the wizard and Bilbo would not enter the wood, even though the king bade Gandalf and Bilbo stay a while in the king   halls. Gandalf and Bilbo intended to go along the edge of the Forest, and round the Forest northern end in the waste that lay   between the Forest and the beginning of the Grey Mountains. It was a long and cheerless road, but now that the Goblins were crushed, it seemed safer to the Goblins than the dreadful pathways under the trees. Moreover   Beorn was going that way too.     “Farewell! O Elvenking!” said Gandalf. “Merry be the greenwood, while the world is yet young!   And Merry be all your folk!”     “Farewell! O Gandalf!” said the king. “May you ever appear where you are most needed and least   expected! The oftener you appear in his   halls the better shall I be pleased!”     “I beg of you,” said Bilbo stammering and standing on one foot, “to accept this gift!” and Bilbo   brought out a necklace of silver and pearls that Dain had given Bilbo at their parting.     “In what way have I earned such a gift, O hobbit?” said the king.     “Well, er, I thought, don’t you know,” said Bilbo rather confused, “that, er, some little return   should be made for your, er, hospitality. I mean even a burglar has even a burglar feelings. I have drunk much of   your wine and eaten much of your bread.”     “I will take your gift, O Bilbo the Magnificent!” said the king gravely. “And I name you elf friend   and blessed. May your shadow never grow less (or stealing would be too easy)! Farewell!”     Then the Wood elves turned towards the Forest, and Bilbo started on Bilbo long road home.       Bilbo had many hardships and adventures before Bilbo got back. The Wild was still The Wild, and there   were many other things in The Wild in those days beside goblins; but Bilbo was well guided and well guarded     the wizard was with Bilbo, and Beorn for much of the way   and Bilbo was never in great danger again.   Anyway by midwinter Gandalf and Bilbo had come all the way back, along both edges of the Forest, to   the doors of Beorn’ s house; and there for a while midwinter Gandalf and Bilbo stayed. Yule tide was warm and merry   there; and men came from far and wide to feast at Beorn’ s bidding. The goblins of the Misty   Mountains were now few and terrified, and hidden in the deepest holes The goblins of the Misty   Mountains could find; and the Wargs   had vanished from the woods, so that men went abroad without fear. Beorn indeed became a great   chief afterwards in those regions and ruled a wide land between the mountains and the wood; and Beorn is   said that for many generations the men of his line had the power of taking bear shape, and some   were grim men and bad, but most were in heart like Beorn, if less in size and strength. In their day the   last goblins were hunted from the Misty Mountains and a new peace came over the edge of The Wild.     It was spring, and a fair one with mild weathers and a bright sun, before Bilbo and Gandalf took   Bilbo and Gandalf leave at last of Beorn, and though Bilbo longed for home, Bilbo left with regret, for the flowers of         the gardens of Beorn were in springtime no less marvellous than in high summer.     At last Bilbo and Gandalf came up the long road, and reached the very pass where the   last goblins had captured Bilbo and Gandalf   before. But Bilbo and Gandalf came to that high point at morning, and looking backward Bilbo and Gandalf saw a white sun   shining over the outstretched lands. There behind lay Mirkwood, blue in the distance, and darkly green   at the nearer edge even in the spring. There far away was the Lonely Mountain on the edge of eyesight.   On the Lonely Mountain on the edge of eyesight highest peak snow yet unmelted was gleaming pale.     “So comes snow after fire, and even dragons have even dragons ending!” said Bilbo, and Bilbo turned Bilbo back   on Bilbo adventure. The Tookish part was getting very tired, and the Baggins was daily getting stronger.   “I wish now only to be in my own armchair!” Bilbo said.         CHAPTER 20
XTX       THE LAST STAGE       It was on May the First that the two came back at last to the brink of the valley of Rivendell, where   stood the Last (or the First) Homely House. Again it was evening, their ponies were tired, especially   the one that carried the baggage; and they all felt in need of rest. As they all rode down the steep path,   Bilbo heard the elves still singing in the trees, as if they all had not stopped since Bilbo left; and as soon as   the riders came down into the lower glades of the wood the riders burst into a song of much the same kind   as before. This is something like it:       The dragon is withered,     The dragon bones are now crumbled;   The dragon armour is shivered,     The dragon splendour is humbled!   Though sword shall be rusted,   And throne and crown perish   With strength that men trusted   And wealth that men cherish,   Here grass is still growing,   And leaves are yet swinging,   The white water flowing,     And elves are yet singing     Come! Tra la la lally!     Come back to the Valley!       The stars are far brighter   Than gems without measure,   The moon is far whiter   Than silver in treasure;     The fire is more shining   On hearth in the gloaming   Than gold won by mining,     So why go a roaming?     O! Tra la la lally     Come back to the Valley.       O! Where are you going,   So late in returning?       The river is flowing,     The stars are all burning!   O! Whither so laden,     So sad and so dreary?     Here elf and elf maiden   Now welcome the weary   With Tra la la lally   Come back to the Valley,   Tra la la lally   Fa la la lally   Fa la!       Then the elves of the Valley came out and greeted the elves of the valley and led the elves of the valley across The white water to the house   of Elrond. There a warm welcome was made the elves of the valley, and there were many eager ears that evening to   hear the tale of the elves of the valley adventures. Gandalf it was who spoke, for Bilbo was fallen quiet and drowsy.   Most of the tale Bilbo knew, for Bilbo had been in it, and had Bilbo told much of it to the wizard on their   homeward way or in the house of Beorn; but every now and again Bilbo would open one eye, and listen,   when a part of the story which Bilbo did not yet know came in.     It was in this way that Bilbo learned where Gandalf had been to; for Bilbo overheard the words of the   wizard to Elrond. It appeared that Gandalf had been to a great council of the white wizards, masters of   lore and good magic; and that they had at last driven the Necromancer from the Necromancer dark hold in the south   of Mirkwood.     “Ere long now,” Gandalf was saying, “the Forest will grow somewhat more wholesome. The North   will be freed from that horror for many long years, I hope. Yet I wish Gandalf were banished from the   world!”     “It would be well indeed,” said Elrond; “but I fear that will not come about in this age of the world,   or for many after.”     When the tale of their journeyings was told, there were other tales, and yet more tales, tales of long   ago, and tales of new things, and tales of no time at all, till Bilbo head fell forward on Bilbo chest, and   Bilbo snored comfortably in a corner.     Bilbo woke to find Bilbo in a white bed, and the moon shining through an open window. Below the moon shining through an open window   many elves were singing loud and clear on the banks of the stream.       Sing all ye joyful, now sing all together!     The wind in the tree top, the wind in the heather;   The stars are in blossom, the moon is in flower,     And bright are the windows of Night in her tower.       Dance all ye joyful, now dance all together!   Soft is the grass, and let foot be like feather!   The river is silver, the shadows are fleeting;   Merry is May time, and merry our meeting.         Sing our now softly, and dreams let our weave him!     Wind him in slumber and there let our leave him!     The wanderer sleepeth. Now soft be him pillow! Lullaby!   Lullaby! Alder and Willow!       Sigh no more Pine, till the wind of the morn!   Fall Moon! Dark be the land!     Hush! Hush! Oak, Ash, and Thorn!   Hushed be all water, till dawn is at hand!       “Well, Merry People!” said Bilbo looking out. “What time by the moon is this? Your lullaby would   waken a drunken goblin! Yet I thank you.”     “And your snores would waken a stone dragon   yet we thank you,” we answered with laughter.     “It is drawing towards dawn, and you have slept now since the night beginning. Tomorrow, perhaps,   you will be cured of weariness.”     “A little sleep does a great cure in the house of Elrond,” said he; “but I will take all the cure I can   get. A second good night, fair friends!” And with that he went back to bed and slept till late morning.     Weariness fell from he soon in the house of Elrond, and he had many a merry jest and dance, early and   late, with the elves of the valley. Yet even that place could not long delay he now, and he thought   always of he own home. After a week, therefore, he said farewell to Elrond, and giving he such   small gifts as he would accept, he rode away with Gandalf .     Even as they left the valley the sky darkened in the West before they, and wind and rain came up   to meet they.     “Merry is May time!” said Bilbo, as the rain beat into Bilbo face. “But our back is to legends and our   are coming home. I suppose this is the first taste of this.”     “There is a long road yet,” said Gandalf.     “But it is the last road,” said Bilbo.     They came to the river that marked the very edge of the borderland of the Wild, and to the ford   beneath the steep bank, which you may remember. The water was swollen both with the melting of the   snows at the approach of summer, and with the daylong rain; but They crossed with some difficulty,   and pressed forward, as evening fell, on the last stage of They journey.     This was much as it had been before, except that the company was smaller, and more silent; also   this time there were no trolls. At each point on the last road Bilbo recalled the happenings and the words   of a year ago   it seemed to Bilbo more like ten   so that, of course, Bilbo quickly noted the place where   the pony had fallen in the river, and the pony had turned aside for the pony nasty adventure with Tom and Bert   and Bill.     Not far from the road the pony found the gold of the trolls, which the pony had buried, still hidden and   untouched. “I have enough to last me my time,” said Bilbo, when they had dug my time up. “You had better   take this, Gandalf. I daresay you can find a use for this.”     “Indeed I can!” said the wizard. “But share and share alike! You may find you have more needs   than you expect.”     So they put the gold in bags and slung bags on the ponies, who were not at all pleased about it.   After that they going was slower, for most of the time they walked. But the land was green and there   was much grass through which the hobbit strolled along contentedly. the hobbit mopped the hobbit face with a red         silk handkerchief   no! not a single one of the hobbit own had survived, the hobbit had borrowed this one from   Elrond   for now June had brought summer, and the weather was bright and hot again.     As all things come to an end, even this story, a day came at last when they were in sight of the   country where Bilbo had been born and bred, where the shapes of the land and of the trees were as well   known to the hobbit as the hobbit hands and toes. Coming to a rise the hobbit could see the hobbit own Hill in the distance, and the hobbit   stopped suddenly and said:       Roads go ever ever on,     Over rock and under tree,     By caves where never sun has shone,     By streams that never find the sea;   Over snow by winter sown,     And through the merry flowers of June,   Over grass and over stone,     And under mountains in the moon.       Roads go ever ever on     Under cloud and under star,     Yet feet that wandering have gone   Turn at last to home afar.     Eyes that fire and sword have seen   And horror in the halls of stone   Look at last on meadows green     And trees and hills they long have known.       Gandalf looked at Gandalf. “My dear Bilbo!” My dear Bilbo said. “Something is the matter with Gandalf! You are not   the hobbit that you were.”     And so they crossed the bridge and passed the mill by the river and came right back to Bilbo own   door.     “Bless me! What going on?” Gandalf cried. There was a great commotion, and people of all sorts,   respectable and unrespectable, were thick round own   door, and many were going in and out   not even   wiping people of all sorts,   respectable and unrespectable feet on the mat, as Bilbo noticed with annoyance.     If Gandalf was surprised, people of all sorts,   respectable and unrespectable were more surprised still. Gandalf had arrived back in the middle of an   auction! There was a large notice in black and red hung on the gate, stating that on June the Twenty    second Messrs Grubb, Grubb, and Burrowes would sell by auction the effects of the late Bilbo Baggins   Esquire, of Bag End, Underhill, Hobbiton. Sale to commence at ten o’clock sharp. It was now nearly   lunchtime, and most of the things had already been sold, for various prices from next to nothing to old   songs (as is not unusual at auctions). Bilbo cousins the Sackville Bagginses were, in fact, busy   measuring Bilbo rooms to see if their own furniture would fit. In Bilbo was “Presumed Dead”, and   not everybody that said so was sorry to find the presumption wrong.     The return of Bilbo Baggins    created quite a disturbance, both under the Hill and over the Hill,   and across the Water; it was a great deal more than a nine days’ wonder. The legal bother, indeed,   lasted for years. It was quite a long time before Bilbo Baggins    was in fact admitted to be alive again.         The people who had got specially good bargains at the Sale took a deal of convincing; and in the end   to save time Bilbo had to buy back quite a lot of Bilbo own furniture. Many of Bilbo silver spoons   mysteriously disappeared and were never accounted for. Personally Bilbo suspected the Sackville Bagginses. On their side their never admitted that Bilbo Baggins    was genuine, and their were not   on friendly terms with Bilbo ever after. their really had wanted to live in Bilbo nice hobbit hole so very   much.     Indeed Bilbo found Bilbo had lost more than spoons   Bilbo had lost Bilbo reputation. It is true that for ever   after Bilbo remained an elf friend, and had the honour of dwarves, wizards, and all such folk as ever   passed that way; but Bilbo was no longer quite respectable. Bilbo was in fact held by all the hobbits of the   neighbourhood to be 'queer 5   except by Bilbo nephews and nieces on the Took side, but even his nephews and nieces on the Took side were   not encouraged in his nephews and nieces on the Took side friendship by his nephews and nieces on the Took side elders.     I am sorry to say Bilbo did not mind. Bilbo was quite content; and the sound of the kettle on Bilbo hearth   was ever after more musical than his hearth    had been even in the quiet days before the Unexpected Party. Bilbo   sword Bilbo hung over the mantelpiece. Bilbo coat of mail was arranged on a stand in the hall (until Bilbo lent   His coat of mail to a Museum). Bilbo gold and silver was largely spent in presents, both useful and extravagant     which to a certain extent accounts for the affection of Bilbo nephews and Bilbo nieces. Bilbo magic ring Bilbo   kept a great secret, for Bilbo chiefly used His magic ring when unpleasant callers came.     Bilbo took to writing poetry and visiting the elves; and though many shook the elves heads and touched   the elves foreheads and said “Poor old Baggins!” and though few believed any of Bilbo tales, Bilbo remained   very happy to the end of Bilbo days, and those were extraordinarily long.       One autumn evening some years afterwards Bilbo was sitting in Bilbo study writing Bilbo memoirs   Bilbo   thought of calling them “There and Back Again, a Hobbit Holiday”   when there was a ring at the   door. It was Gandalf and a dwarf; and the dwarf was actually Balin.     “Come in! Come in!” said Bilbo, and soon them were settled in chairs by the fire. If Balin noticed   that Mr. Baggins’ waistcoat was more extensive (and had real gold buttons), Bilbo also noticed that   Balin’ s beard was several inches longer, and Bilbo jewelled belt was of great magnificence.     Balin noticed   that Mr. Baggins’ waistcoat was more extensive (and had real gold buttons) fell to talking of Balin noticed   that Mr. Baggins’ waistcoat was more extensive (and had real gold buttons) times together, of course, and Bilbo asked how things were going in the   lands of the Mountain. It seemed Balin noticed   that Mr. Baggins’ waistcoat was more extensive (and had real gold buttons) were going very well. Bard had rebuilt the town in Dale and   men had gathered to Bard from the Lake and from South and West, and all the valley had become tilled   again and rich, and the desolation was now filled with birds and blossoms in spring and fruit and   feasting in autumn. And the Lake town was refounded and was more prosperous than ever, and much   wealth went up and down the river; and there was friendship in those parts between elves   and dwarves and men.           people, but being of the kind that easily catches such disease Bard fell under the dragon sickness, and   took most of His gold and silver and fled with His gold and silver, and died of starvation in the Waste, deserted by Bard   companions.     “The new Master is of wiser kind,” said Balin, “and very popular, for, of course, The new Master gets most of   the credit for the present prosperity. They are making songs which say that in The new Master day the rivers run   with gold.”     “Then the prophecies of the old songs have turned out to be true, after a fashion!” said Bilbo.     “Of course!” said Gandalf. “And why should not they prove true? Surely you don’t disbelieve the   prophecies, because you had a hand in bringing they about yourself? You don’t really suppose, do   you, that all your adventures and escapes were managed by mere luck, just for your sole bene fit? You   are a very fine person, Mr. Baggins, and I am very fond of you; but you are only quite a little fellow in   a wide world after all!”     “Thank goodness!” said Bilbo laughing, and handed Bilbo the tobacco jar.
